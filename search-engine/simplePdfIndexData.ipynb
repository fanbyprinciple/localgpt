MIET MIMarEST \\n* Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway\\n* Corresponding Author. Email: aybars.oruc@ntnu.no\\nSynopsis \\nDevelopments in technology bring inherent risks along with convenience. Undoubtedly, cyberattacks \\nconstitute one potentially serious risk. While a stereotypical scenario involves a curious teenager sitting in \\nfront of his computer at home, a much more critical threat comes from experienced professionals, supported \\nby states, who are specially trained and who have the necessary technological equipment to do great harm. \\nThese cyberattacks exert a negative impact on the maritime industry due to the wide usage area of both \\ninformation technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems. On a related note, opponents of \\nautonomous ship projects can effectively cite the weaknesses detected in navigation systems onboard ships. \\nExamination of cyberattacks in the maritime industry as reflected in the press or in academic studies reveals \\nclaims that some of these attacks are state-sponsored. However, no country has to date accepted responsibility \\nfor such cyberattacks. Although those targeted by such accusations have neither confirmed nor rejected \\nresponsibility, the nature of the attacks – sophisticated or requiring high-cost equipment – raises the \\npossibility that behind the attacks are countries that may have conducted research studies for defensive or \\noffensive purposes. China, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Turkey have been named among the countries \\ncarrying out cyberattacks on the maritime industry. It is envisaged that these attacks are based on motivations \\nsuch as information theft, defence research or sabotage of exploration for underground sources. Among the \\ncyberattacks on vessels that have been assessed as state-sponsored, the most common have involved GPS \\njamming, rendering GPS useless, and GPS spoofing that causes the GPS to report an incorrect position for a \\nship at sea. This study examines the cyberattacks on the maritime industry that are asserted as state-sponsored \\nas well as the parties involved in these attacks and the possible objectives of those parties. \\nKeywords: Maritime; ship; cybersecurity; state-sponsored cyberattack \\n1. Introduction\\nCybersecurity concerns are growing along with the advancement of technologies, the extensive use of digital\\nand cyber-physical networks on ships, and autonomous ship initiatives such as the Maritime Unmanned \\nNavigation through Intelligence in Networks (MUNIN), Autosea and Yara Birkeland (Brekke et al. 2019; \\nMUNIN 2012; Yara International 2018). Furthermore, cybersecurity has led other maritime-related organisations \\nto become involved due to cyber incidents both at sea and on shore.  \\nNon-profit organisations such as the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF) and Chemical \\nDistribution Institute (CDI) have begun to pressure tanker operators to take action against cyber threats by \\noffering vetting services for the commercial operations of tanker operators. The Tanker Management and Self-\\nAssessment (TMSA) and Ship Inspection Report Program (SIRE) questionnaires developed by OCIMF have \\nbeen enhanced with queries relevant to cybersecurity. Specific cybersecurity questions have been incorporated \\ninto CDI’s Ship Inspection Report (SIR) questionnaire. RightShip, which offers vetting services for dry cargo \\nships, has introduced cybersecurity questions into its questionnaire as well (Oruc 2019). \\nThe maritime sector has also seen initiatives for examining cybersecurity problems, such as ‘Cyber-MAR’ \\n(Cyber-MAR 2019), ‘Maritime Cyber Resilience’ (MarCy) (CRISTIN 2020), ‘Cyber Security of Maritime ICT-\\nBased Systems’ (University of Rijeka 2019) and the project of ‘Centre for Maritime Cyber Security’ at Tallinn \\nUniversity of Technology (CORDIS 2020). Countries have also started developing their own research facilities. \\nThe Danish Maritime Cybersecurity Unit was established by the Danish Maritime Authority in June 2018 \\n(Danish Maritime Cybersecurity Unit 2019). The Maritime Cybersecurity Operations Centre was opened in 2019 \\nby the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore 2019). Lastly, the \\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO) has not been indifferent to developments. In accordance with \\nInternational Safety Management (ISM) Code, all maritime companies are mandated to insert a ‘Guidelines on \\nMaritime Cyber Risk Management’ into their safety management system, and this will be checked in the first \\nannual verification of the company’s Document of Compliance (DoC) as of 1 January 2021 (IMO 2017). \\nIndividuals or teams may arrange cyberattacks for varied purposes. Additionally, governments are pursuing \\nresearch not only on cybersecurity but also investigating purposes for cyberattack. Because of the technical \\nfacilities and qualified staff that states can offer, state-sponsored cyberattacks are highly sophisticated, yielding \\nmore serious results than attacks promoted by individuals or private groups. For instance, the Center for \\nAdvanced Defense (C4ADS) reported that the alleged attacks by Russia have affected 1,311 civilian vessels in \\nabout a 30-month period (C4ADS 2019). In other words, attacks are also harming merchant vessels.  \\nConference Proceedings of INEC\\n15th International Naval Engineering Conference & Exhibition\\nhttps://doi.org/10.24868/issn.2515-818X.2020.021\\nAlthough researchers have investigated the subject of maritime cybersecurity, current academic studies to \\ndate are not sufficient. While considerable work has examined state-sponsored attacks, no studies have been \\nidentified that focus on these attacks within the maritime industry. Therefore, this paper intends to contribute to \\nthe development of the literature.  \\n2. Cyberattacks in General Terms\\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines cyberattack as an attempt to destroy,\\nexpose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorised access to or make unauthorised use of an asset (ISO 2018). \\nCyberattacks may be carried out against companies or governments as well as individuals. Such attacks can be \\nlaunched by computers, smartphones, tablets or electronic equipment developed for cyberattacks. The types of \\ncyberattacks are divided into two categories: ‘Targeted Attacks’ and ‘Untargeted Attacks’. \\n•\\nTargeted Attacks: In such attacks, a company or a ship’s systems and data are the intended targets (BIMCO\\n2018).\\n•\\nUntargeted Attacks: In this kind of attack, the systems and data belonging to a company or ship are among\\nmany potential targets (BIMCO 2018).\\nThe concept of ‘Maritime Security’ covers illegal and planned attacks against ships, port facilities and crew. \\nThe International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) code was published to deter terror rampages against \\nships, ports and facilities after the ‘September 11’ attacks. ‘Maritime Cybersecurity’ is investigated by IMO \\nunder the Maritime Security category. The Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) and Facilitation Committee \\n(FAL) publish regulations and guidance, which are then circulated to the maritime sector.  \\n2.1. \\nTypical Characteristics of Cyber Threats \\nAs attack levels increase from level 1 to level 5, they become more sophisticated. Level advancement implies \\nnot only improved attack methods but also an increase in the qualification of aggressive groups. A level 1 attack \\ncan be carried out by a teenager sitting in front of a computer at home, even for entertainment purposes, while at \\nlevel 5, the attackers appear to be more well-informed and experienced as well as supported by countries for \\npolitical or military purposes. In other words, such high-level attacks are state-sponsored. Table 1 displays the \\nfive levels of cyber threats, dividing actors into five categories (Bodeau et al. 2010). \\nTable 1: Typical characteristics of cyber threats (Bodeau et al. 2010) \\nLevel \\nTypical Threat Actors \\nTypical Intents of Threat Actors \\n1 \\nCyber Vandalism \\nHackers, taggers, and ‘script kiddies’; \\nsmall disaffected groups of the above \\nDisrupt and/or embarrass the victimised organisation \\nor type of organisation (e.g. a specific department or \\nfederal government as a whole) \\n2 \\nCyber Theft / Crime \\nIndividuals or small, loosely affiliated \\ngroups; \\npolitical \\nor \\nideological \\nactivists; terrorists; domestic insiders; \\nindustrial espionage; spammers \\nObtain critical information and/or usurp or disrupt the \\norganisation’s business or mission functions for profit \\nor ideological cause \\n3 \\nCyber Incursion \\n/ Surveillance \\nNation-state \\ngovernment \\nentity; \\npatriotic hacker group; sophisticated \\nterrorist group; professional organised \\ncriminal enterprise \\nIncrease knowledge of general infrastructure; plant \\nseeds for future attacks; obtain or modify specific \\ninformation \\nand/or \\ndisrupt \\ncyber \\nresources, \\nspecifically resources associated with missions or \\neven information types \\n4 \\nCyber Sabotage \\n/ Espionage \\nProfessional intelligence organisation \\nor military service operative \\nObtain specific high-value information, undermine or \\nimpede critical aspects of a mission, programme or \\nenterprise, or place itself in a position to do so in the \\nfuture \\n5 \\nCyber Conflict / \\nWarfare \\nNation-state \\nmilitary, \\npossibly \\nsupported by their intelligence service; \\nvery \\nsophisticated \\nand \\ncapable \\ninsurgent or terrorist group \\nSeverely undermine or destroy an organisation’s use \\nof its mission, information and/or infrastructure \\n2.2. \\nImplemented Cyberattack Methods for State-Sponsored Attacks \\nThe current technological era has inaugurated an age of cyber threats as well. Cyberattacks are carried out by \\nmalicious individuals, groups or state-sponsored organisations using many different methods. This section \\nexplains the techniques employed in allegedly state-sponsored cyberattacks in the maritime industry. \\nConference Proceedings of INEC\\n15th International Naval Engineering Conference & Exhibition\\nhttps://doi.org/10.24868/issn.2515-818X.2020.021\\n2.2.1. GPS Jamming \\nAccording to the C4ADS, Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming is also called brute force jamming \\n(C4ADS 2019). This type of attack involves GPS jamming where radio noise is broadcast on the GPS frequency, \\nblocking the use of GPS and potentially disabling a vessel’s ability to navigate safely (Vistiaho 2017). However, \\na GPS failure alert may notify an officer of the problem. Further countermeasures include anti-jamming devices \\nto use against GPS jamming attacks. Because the applications of these devices are currently available only to \\nland vehicles, no such implementation currently exists for ships.  \\n2.2.2. GPS Spoofing \\nA GPS spoofing attack causes the targeted GPS to display the wrong location by receiving a false GPS signal \\n(Lund et al. 2018). Because an officer on the bridge of a ship might not detect this type of attack, such an attack \\nis more dangerous than a GPS jamming attack (Humphreys et al. 2008). An undetected attack of this nature \\nendangers the safe navigation of a ship.  \\n2.2.3. Spear Phishing \\nIn this scenario, the attacker sends an e-mail to the victim’s account. The target may be an individual, \\ndepartment or company. The malevolent e-mail, which appears to be sent from a reputable institution such as a \\nbank, an e-mail provider or a university, often requests the recipient to click a link. The purpose of this attack is \\npersonal data theft by prompting the victim to enter the desired information on a pop-up page, which might \\ninclude passwords, personal information and credit card numbers. Additionally, a customised e-mail may be sent \\nthat might contain the name, logo or personal details of the victim (Sophos 2013). \\n2.2.4. Malware \\nHarmful software, also known by the generic term malware, includes viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, etc. \\nMalware is used to damage infected devices or files and to steal personal data, photos and videos (Sophos 2013). \\nMalware usually attacks users through warez software and is easily accessed by attackers through files \\ndownloaded via torrent, USB (Universal Serial Bus) memory sticks or any visited websites. Connecting a mobile \\nphone to a ship’s computer to charge can cause the virus to infiltrate the ship’s network and may lead to the \\ncrashing of some systems like the ship’s Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS). Many types \\nof malware are a current threat to users. Of these, the Petya virus, used for ransomware attacks, should be \\nspecifically examined, considering the damage it has caused to Maersk, making its name infamous in the \\nmaritime sector. Essentially, Petya renders all files on the victim’s computer inaccessible, meaning these files \\ncannot be accessed unless a ransom is paid to the Bitcoin account issued by the attacker (Trend Micro 2017). \\nThe Danish maritime company Maersk suffered about $300 million in damages from a Petya-based attack \\n(Fadilpašić 2017). On a related note, another ransomware product, SamSam software, was used in a cyberattack \\non the Port of San Diego (Senzee 2019). \\n2.3. \\nCyber Incidents in the Maritime Industry \\nCyberattacks in the maritime sector have been on the increase, particularly in recent years. The threats are \\ntargeting offices, ports and even ships. Attacks, especially when levied against ships, cause more concern \\nbecause they can lead to injury of individuals and marine pollution. As an additional cautionary note, the \\npossibility of cyberattacks is a critical question mark in autonomous ship projects, adding urgency to the \\nnecessity of a closer review of cyberattacks. The maritime sector is experiencing both targeted and untargeted \\nattacks. In particular, the ransomware attack that caused Maersk to lose $300 million serves as a critical warning \\nfor untargeted attacks in the maritime industry. In the area of information theft, attacks can be carried out against \\nthe offices of maritime companies, and attackers can demand ransom. Furthermore, attacks may allegedly be \\nsupported by a state for both political and military purposes. It is possible to claim that attacks on the GPS \\nsystems of ships in particular are supported by governments because of being sophisticated of GPS attacks. In \\naddition to the GPS attacks discussed here, the event of attackers taking complete possession of a massive \\ncontainer vessel in 2017 received extensive news coverage (Blake 2017). Ports represent another area in the \\nmaritime sector to be targeted. In general, port attacks are planned as part of carrying out smuggling activities. \\nTable 2, corresponding to the years 2011-2019, reveals how cyberattacks reflected in the press have increased, \\nespecially in recent years. The table includes a total of 22 incidents, 17 of which were shore-based attacks, and \\nfive of which were targeted towards vessels.

The \\nsuspects include China, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Turkey. \\n3.1. \\nChina \\nIn April 2012, the Danish Maritime Authority was subjected to a critical cyberattack, though the cyberattack \\nwas not publicly announced until September 2014 (Cyber Keel 2014). The cybersecurity breach under \\ndiscussion was discovered in 2014 after an American IT specialist reported it. Investigations revealed that when \\na Danish Maritime Authority employee opened a PDF file containing the virus that was sent as an e-mail \\nattachment, the virus corrupted the employee’s computer and infected the attached network. Investigation \\nshowed that the attackers wanted confidential information regarding Danish shipping companies and the \\nmerchant fleet. The entire network system was shut down for several days while new anti-virus programmes \\nwere installed. Danish Defence Intelligence Service announced that this attack was highly sophisticated, that it \\nwas state-sponsored and that evidence pointed to the attack being organized by China. The Chinese Embassy in \\nCopenhagen refuted all accusations and announced that Chinese officials did not know about this attack (The \\nLocal 2014). \\nThis targeted attack illustrates the spear-phishing method. Corporate or government staff must be mindful of \\nthe potential for this type of attack, taking precautions when reviewing e-mails received from unrecognised \\nparties. Unfortunately, in this situation, if the American IT expert had not alerted the Danish Maritime Authority, \\nthe attackers might have been able to steal additional amounts of sensitive information for some time longer. \\nFollowing this event and after the 2017 cyberattack that caused substantial damage to Maersk, one of the world’s \\nleading maritime firms, the Danish government took heed and took steps to create an official cybersecurity unit. \\nThus, in June 2018, the Danish Maritime Authority established the Danish Maritime Cybersecurity Unit. \\nThis unit, which serves players in the Danish maritime sector, also organises professional workshops and \\nconferences especially for the maritime sector regarding cybersecurity. Not only do they develop strategy, but \\nthey play an essential role in implementing the formulated plans. An example of this unit’s efforts is the \\ndocument ‘Cyber and Information Strategy for the Maritime Sector’, covering 2019-2022 (Danish Maritime \\nCybersecurity Unit 2019). \\n3.2. \\nIran \\nThe Port of San Diego in the USA was subjected to cyberattack on 25 September 2018 (IMarEST 2018). \\nThis incident, identified as a ransomware attack named SamSam, affected over 200 victims including hospitals, \\nmunicipalities and public agencies as well as the port itself, inflicting $30 million in economic damage (U.S. \\nDepartment of Justice 2018). Two Iranians orchestrated the attack, which demanded ransom over Bitcoin. The \\ninvestigators of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) consider such attacks to be highly sophisticated as well as \\nsupported by Iran as a state-sponsored cyberattack (ABS 2020; Senzee 2019).  \\n3.3. \\nNorth Korea \\nIn April 2016, South Korea announced that around 280 vessels were under a GPS jamming attack that forced \\nthe affected vessels to return to port (Graham 2017). South Korea claimed that this attack was organised by \\nNorth Korea. However, North Korea denied this claim (Saul 2017). Even if it cannot be verified with certainty \\nthat North Korea carried out this attack, investigations that revealed the complexity of the attack showed it to be \\nhighly sophisticated. Moreover, GPS jamming attacks cannot be carried out using a single computer but require \\nspecific technical equipment. For this reason, this incident was likely to be a state-sponsored attack. eLoran has \\nbeen developed against GPS jamming and spoofing attacks by South Korea (Cozzens 2020). \\n3.4. \\nRussia \\nOn 22 June 2017, a ship off the Novorossiysk-Russia shore notified the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center \\nabout a problem with GPS. According to the report, the ship’s GPS showed the wrong position, a problem that \\nalso affected more than 20 other vessels in the area. Figure 1 illustrates the spoofed vessel location and actual \\nvessel location in this incident. The ship’s GPS gave a position inland (near the Gelendyhik Airport), but the \\nvessel was drifting more than 25 NM (nautical mile) from the given coordinates. Various investigations revealed \\nthat this was a GPS spoofing cyberattack. Experts claimed that Russia had organised the attack to test the \\ndefence system against American missiles (Humphreys 2017; Goward 2017). \\nConference Proceedings of INEC\\n15th International Naval Engineering Conference & Exhibition\\nhttps://doi.org/10.24868/issn.2515-818X.2020.021\\n \\n  \\n \\nFigure 1: Actual and Spoofed Vessel Locations (C4ADS 2019) \\nGPS attacks, by their nature, cannot be carried out only with computers but require additional technical \\nequipment as mentioned above. Although the attack was not confirmed by the Russian government, it could be \\ninferred that the attack was state-sponsored, given the scope of the attack and the number of ships affected. \\nThis case that Russia supposedly created and that the press has reported is not an isolated one in terms of \\nsuch allegations. In 2019, the U.S.-based non-profit Center for Advanced Defence Studies (C4ADS) released a \\ncomprehensive report entitled ‘Above Us Only Stars’. This report estimated that a total of 1,311 civilian vessels \\nwere damaged by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attacks conducted by Russia between \\nFebruary 2016 and November 2018. As per C4ADS, such GNSS spoofing activities are potentially carried out \\nfor defensive reasons concerning strategic locations in Russia or for checking that country’s ability to attack \\n(C4ADS 2019). \\n3.5. \\nTurkey \\nAs per the researches, numerous hydrocarbon reserves may be located in the Mediterranean around the island \\nof Cyprus (Faustmann et al. 2012). In this sense, on 26 January 2007, the Greek Cypriot Southern Cyprus \\nAdministration (GCASC) separated the region identified as its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ) into 13 \\nzones and began licensing those zones to oil exploration firms (Arıdemir and Allı 2019). These firms thus \\nobtained the privilege to explore for hydrocarbons in the areas where they were licensed. However, several of \\nthe identified areas overlap with the Turkish continental shelf and the EEZ of the Turkish Republic of Northern \\nCyprus (TRNC). Figure 2 illustrates the EEZ claimed by the GCASC, the Turkish continental shelf alleged by \\nTurkey, the EEZ claimed by the TRNC and the disputed zones (Yilmaz 2019). \\n \\n \\nFigure 2: Disputed Zones and EEZs of the TRNC and the GCASC (Yilmaz 2019) \\nConference Proceedings of INEC\\n15th International Naval Engineering Conference & Exhibition\\nhttps://doi.org/10.24868/issn.2515-818X.2020.021\\n \\n  \\nThe Republic of Turkey never considered it acceptable to perform reserve research in the disputed regions. \\nFirst, on 17 March 2002, the Turkish Navy banned the ‘Northern Access’ research vessel from carrying out \\nseismic studies on the Turkish continental shelf, and the Turkish Navy imposed similar limitations in 2016 and \\n2018 (Ozkaya 2018). Ships of the Republic of Turkey, the ‘Yavuz’, ‘Fatih’ and ‘Barbaros Hayrettin Pasha’, are \\ncontinuing to conduct hydrocarbon exploration operations within the disputed areas around the island of Cyprus. \\nDuring 2018, multiple incidents involving GPS interference took place across the island of Cyprus. The \\nNATO Shipping Centre and U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) confirm these interruptions (U.S. \\nMaritime Administration 2018; NATO Shipping Center 2018). Figure 3 shows the GPS interference that has \\noccurred off Cyprus. (NATO Shipping Center 2018) \\n \\n \\nFigure 3: Area with GPS Interference (NATO Shipping Center 2018) \\nAdditionally, on the organisation’s website, the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center (USCG NAVCEN) \\nposts numerous GPS interference problems received in reports. Around 2018 and 2019, three GPS problems \\nwere recorded from the Cyprus region. No reason for two of these was identified, and they were reported as \\n‘Unknown Interference’ in the (USCG NAVCEN 2020) records. \\nThe Norwegian Shipowner’s Mutual War Risks Insurance report focuses on the probability of GPS \\ninterference occurring around the island of Cyprus caused by Turkey (2018 cited Denizcilik Bilgileri 2018). \\nConsidering together the records of USCG NAVCEN, MARAD and the NATO Shipping Centre from the year \\n2018, the absence of any clarification of the origin of most of the GPS problems encountered, the frequency of \\nGPS interference that generally occurred in the disputed area and the Turkish Navy’s interference towards the \\nresearch vessels, it is probable that the goal was to prevent the research vessels from performing hydrocarbon \\nresearch in the controversial region by disrupting GPS signals using a GPS jamming attack by the Republic of \\nTurkey. This possibility, though, remains to be admitted by the Republic of Turkey. \\n \\n \\nFigure 4: KORAL - Turkish Electronic Warfare Vehicle (Aselsan 2017) \\nConference Proceedings of INEC\\n15th International Naval Engineering Conference & Exhibition\\nhttps://doi.org/10.24868/issn.2515-818X.2020.021\\n \\n  \\n‘KORAL’, developed by Aselsan, has been used by the Turkish army for electronic warfare since 2016  \\n(Sabah 2016). Figure 4 shows photos of ‘KORAL’. This system has various capabilities, including launching a \\nGPS jamming attack. If the claim in 2018 was correct, KORAL must have been used in the attacks against the \\nresearch vessels in the vicinity of Cyprus. In 2019, another electronic warfare vehicle developed by Aselsan, \\ncalled ‘REDET-II’, was delivered to the Turkish army (C4Defence 2019).  \\n4. Findings \\nTwenty-two maritime cybersecurity incidents were detected between 2011 and 2019. Even though 17 of \\nthese were shore-based incidents, involving ports and shipping companies, five of them were attacks on vessels \\nat sea. However, it is highly probable that the attacks on vessels have been even more widespread than those \\nreported. Examination of USCG NAVCEN records found that between 4 February 2017 and 13 March 2020, 68 \\ncases involving GPS interference were recorded for marine-type devices. Of those 68 records, 56 were reported \\nas ‘Unknown Interference’ after investigation. In other words, no explanation was stated for these GPS-related \\ntroubles. \\nChina, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Turkey are alleged to have carried out attacks affecting the maritime \\nindustry. Russia is believed to be capable of carrying out GPS spoofing attacks. Turkey and North Korea are \\nsuspected of GPS jamming attacks. China and Iran are asserted to have the capacity to carry out shore-based \\ncyberattacks. \\nTurkey is allegedly accused of trying to blockade hydrocarbon exploration activities around the island of \\nCyprus, and Russia is alleged to be causing GPS interference for the intent of defence or researching electronic \\nwarfare technologies. \\nAny claims or state-sponsored allegations in incidents related to the maritime industry have not been \\naccepted by the countries so accused. \\nThe alleged state-sponsored ship attacks under consideration were limited to GPS. \\nIn 2012, the attack on the Danish Maritime Authority, allegedly planned by the Chinese government, was the \\nfirst to target a governmental organisation directly related to the maritime industry. \\nThe GPS jamming attack, which was supposedly carried out by North Korea in 2016 and impacted more than \\n280 vessels, came to light as the incident that affected the most vessels at one time. \\nBetween February 2016 and November 2018, a total of 1,311 civilian vessels’ navigation systems were \\nallegedly affected due to Russian-organised GNSS spoofing attacks. Taking into consideration the current \\nstatements, Russia appears to be the state behind most attacks on marine vessels. \\nThe attacks influence not only state institutions but also private industry and individuals. Since GPS attacks \\nthreaten a region, they impact all vessels in the subject area. In comparison, attacks against land facilities aim at \\nobtaining data or destroying a facility’s computer infrastructure. \\nCyber incident record for war ships are not available. It is likely that war ships are affected from cyber \\nincidents, however, these incidents are not disclosed by navies suffering such attacks. Leaders are likely \\ncovering up the attacks to avoid further damage publicly. \\n5. Conclusion \\nAdvances in technology have often influenced aggressor states’ methods of attack. Organisations or \\ngovernments can now hack information using cyberattacks without the requirement for a spy, or they can limit \\nships’ ability to navigate safely by removing GPS capability in an area. State-sponsored attacks threaten to exert \\na detrimental effect on merchant shipping, an impact likely to worsen if various states’ attack capabilities are \\nstrengthened over the coming years and more countries begin to participate in this activity. Added to the \\ndifficulty is the reality that states typically cover up such attacks. Throughout the research endeavour, attempts \\nwere made to collect information via e-mail and telephone from different organisations. The e-mails sent, \\nhowever, received either no answer or feedback saying that no details could be provided. Further research could \\nevaluate the efforts of states to counter possible cyberattacks impacting the maritime industry. An additional \\ntopic for investigation would be to examine how such attacks can affect merchant shipping and assess the \\ndetrimental impacts on the global supply chain. \\nAcknowledgements  \\nThis study was supported by the project ‘Maritime Cyber Resilience’ (MarCy) funded by the Research \\nCouncil of Norway. \\n \\nConference Proceedings of INEC\\n15th International Naval Engineering Conference & Exhibition\\nhttps://doi.org/10.24868/issn.2515-818X.2020.021\\n \\n  \\nReferences \\nABS, 2020.

Content \\nand Use. This chapter provides introductory and \\nexplanatory material such as General Instructions and Guidelines for the \\nconduct of exercises and where appropriate, special safety precautions.  \\n \\n01002.   Command and Control  \\n \\n(a) \\nOfficer Scheduling Exercise (OSE).   The OSE is the officer \\nwho originates the exercise and orders it to take place. He will issue \\nbasic instructions that will include the objective of the exercise, the \\ndesignation of the exercise area, allocation of forces/units and the \\nnecessary coordinating instructions. He will also designate the Officer \\nConducting the Exercise (OCE).  \\n \\n(b) \\nOfficer Conducting Exercise (OCE).   The OCE is responsible \\nto the OSE for the conduct of the exercise. He will issue necessary \\nsupplementary instructions and detailed orders to all the participating \\nunits, safety precautions, reports required from participants and \\nconduct of the exercise as it develops. The OCE shall ensure that \\nparticipants in the exercise attend a detailed briefing prior to the \\nconduct of the exercise.  \\n \\n(c) \\nOfficer in Tactical Command (OTC).   The OTC is the senior \\nofficer present; eligible to assume command or the officer to whom he \\nhas delegated tactical command. He shall ensure that all elements of \\nan exercise requiring pre-exercise briefing are covered in the briefing \\nprior to the conduct of the exercise.  \\n \\n(d) \\n Officer Conducting the Serial (OCS).   The OCS is the officer \\ndesignated to exercise tactical control over assigned forces for a \\nspecific exercise serial.  \\n \\n01003.    Safety  \\n \\n(a) \\nSafety of participating units including safety of personnel and \\nequipment is paramount in the conduct of exercises. Departure from \\n \\n \\n \\n                                 RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (GEN) \\n \\n \\nI-2 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\nestablished safety rules and precautions for the sake of completing an \\nexercise is never warranted. All safeguards must be taken to ensure \\nthat the training environment does not create an actual hazard or \\nbypass existing safety precautions. \\n \\n(b) \\nViolation of established safety rules during an exercise shall be \\nthe subject of specific comment in a post-exercise debrief. Safety \\ncontroller will immediately inform the OCE during the conduct of \\nexercise of impending violations of safety precautions, or their \\ninfraction. If in the judgment of the OCE, personnel or equipment is \\nendangered, he shall terminate either the exercise or the exercise \\nphase, until the reported condition is remedied.  \\n \\n(c) \\n For gunnery and missile exercises, accepted basic rules will \\napply. The OCE shall ensure that general safety rules and precautions \\nare covered in the briefing prior to conduct of the exercise. \\n \\n(d) \\nCommanding Officers of individual units are to immediately \\nreport any perceived safety hazard to the OCE by FAM. \\n \\n01004.   Pre-Exercise Considerations. To ensure that the exercise is \\ncompleted safely and with no misunderstanding, it is mandatory that a detailed \\nbriefing is carried out prior to an exercise. Such a briefing will invariably be \\ncarried out by the fleet staff for tactical exercises, weapon firing and Special \\nDay at Sea. Senior Officers of detached groups/ units are to undertake such \\nbriefings, as necessary.  \\n \\n(a) \\nASW Exercise Considerations.   The pre-exercise briefing for \\nan antisubmarine (ASW) exercise shall include, as a minimum, the \\nfollowing aspects:-  \\n \\n(i) \\nSafety procedures for ships and submarines.  \\n \\n(ii) \\nSubmarine distress procedures including search and \\nrescue procedures to be followed.  \\n \\n(iii) \\nASW aircraft safety considerations. \\n \\n(iv) \\nTorpedo recovery and search procedures.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                 RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (GEN) \\n \\n \\nI-3 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n(v) \\nSafety observers designated for the exercise and their \\nduties.  \\n \\n(vi) \\nSubmarine communication methods, including flares and \\ndistress signals.  \\n \\n(vii) \\n Submarine and/or exercise target characteristics and \\nlimitations, including submarine safe depth requirements, and \\nthe surfacing methods to be employed.  \\n \\n(viii) \\n Exercise structure including type of exercise, start and \\nstop times, search plans and support methods, and any other \\nparameters.  \\n \\n(ix) \\nEffect of weather and visibility, if any, on the conduct of \\nthe exercise. \\n \\n(b) \\n Missile and Gunnery Exercise Considerations. \\n \\n(i) \\n Safety in conduct of the exercise and realism in training \\nare twin goals. The OCE shall brief all participants prior to the \\nconduct of exercise on the safe firing areas, characteristics of \\nweapons to be used, safety rules and precautions, including \\nsafety zones, radar and/or visual range clearance of the firing \\narc, duties of safety controller etc. \\n  \\n(ii) \\n In preparing for missile or gunnery exercise, the OCE \\nshould give attention to the selection of an appropriate tactical \\nsituation. Such a situation is limited by the need to maintain \\nadequate safety measures and restrictions on ammunition \\nexpenditure.  \\n \\n(iii) \\nIt is desired to exercise techniques requiring use of a new \\nplan; such plan must be fully described in the exercise orders \\nand covered by the OTC in the briefing prior to conduct of the \\nexercise.  \\n \\n(c) \\nGeneral Considerations. \\n \\n(i) \\nExercises included in this guide may be modified as \\nrequired \\nto \\nmeet \\noperational \\nrequirements \\nor \\nweather \\n \\n \\n \\n                                 RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (GEN) \\n \\n \\nI-4 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\nrestrictions. It is the responsibility of the OCE to ascertain \\nspecific parameters of the modified exercise prior to conduct of \\nthe exercise.  \\n \\n(ii) \\nDuring tactical exercises, umpires will be nominated by \\nthe OSE/OCE and causalities may be imposed as necessary.  \\n \\n(iii) \\nRecognition of training and its application to safety is of \\nutmost importance and may be added as an integral part of an \\nexercise. It is highly desirable to practice the use of identification \\nsystems whenever possible. Accordingly, instructions for their \\nuse may be added to an exercise where appropriate.  \\n \\n01005.   Communications.   Successful conduct of an exercise depends on \\ngood \\ncommunications. \\nTherefore, \\nthe \\nOCE \\nshall \\nensure \\nthat \\nall \\ncommunication preparations have been made prior to the conduct of the \\nexercise. The exercise must include suitable communication plan, and that the \\ndetails of the circuit required by the exercise are covered in the briefing prior to \\nthe conduct of the exercise. Communication checks in harbour between units \\nmust be checked whenever possible, especially when ships under different Op \\nAuthorities are expected to operate in company. \\n \\n01006.   Pre-Exercise Preparations – OCE.  The OCE is to take the following \\nactions, as appropriate, prior to an exercise: -  \\n \\n(a) \\n Issue of exercise/deployment programme, catering for specific \\nrequirements of any ship or group of ships, SHOPS, etc.  \\n \\n(b) \\nRequisition for air effort as per relevant articles of Command \\nOrders.  \\n \\n(c) \\n Issue settings for tactical exercises as necessary.  \\n \\n(d) \\nLiaise with Headquarters and C of Y for sailing signal and \\ncasting off of ships. Additionally, tie up any berthing requirements for \\nloading/ unloading articles.   \\n \\n(e) \\nIssue Boiler/ Motoring power signal.  \\n \\n(f) \\nIntimate ships regarding embarkation of personnel.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                 RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (GEN) \\n \\n \\nI-5 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n(g) \\nIssue Helo embarkation signal.  \\n \\n(h) \\nPropose areas to Head Quarters for PMF/ EAT and submarine \\nexercises.  \\n \\n(j) \\nPromulgation of NAVAREA for PMF/ EAT/ NGFS firing. \\n \\n(k) \\nObtain approval for NGFS firing/ streaming of VDS/ Towed \\nArray, etc.  \\n \\n(l) \\nConduct CIT as necessary.  \\n \\n(m) \\nArrange supply of weapons as necessary.  \\n \\n(n) \\nArrange for targets/ target towing/ BDA. \\n \\n(p) \\nForward LOGREQ, if applicable.  \\n \\n(q) \\nConduct briefing.  \\n \\n(r) \\nPromulgate Orders, CASEX and policy signals, etc. for each \\nserial. \\n \\n(s) \\nNominate OCS/ FAAWC/ Scr Cdr/ ACS/ HCS for relevant serials \\nas required. \\n \\n(t) \\nIssue communication /EEP/ EMCON orders. \\n \\n(u) \\nIssue safety instructions if required. \\n \\n01007.   Pre-Exercise Preparations – Ships. \\n \\n(a) \\nOperational ships are to be ready in all respects to sail at short \\nnotice. However, ships are to undertake specific preparations prior to \\nan Exercise/ Deployment to derive maximum training and work-up \\nvalue.  \\n \\n(b) \\nSpecific requirements of the ships, including SHOPS/ Trials/ \\nCalibration requirements are to reach the OTC at least 07 days prior to \\nthe scheduled exercise. It must be appreciated that it is difficult to \\n \\n \\n \\n                                 RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (GEN) \\n \\n \\nI-6 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\nincorporate even a simple exercise in the programme at a later stage \\ndue to consort requirement as well as time and space constraints.  \\n \\n(c) \\nSea and Action drills are to be carried out additionally one day \\nprior to the sea sortie and all efforts are to be made to ensure \\nequipment availability at peak performance for the exercise.  \\n \\n(d) \\nCommunication checks are to be carried out one day prior to \\nsailing. \\n \\n(e) \\nOn receipt of the Exercise/ Deployment programme, ships are to \\nissue signals/ order as necessary for the serials where they have been \\nnominated as the OCS. If considered necessary for the purpose of \\nsafety and smooth conduct, a briefing for the participating units is to be \\ncarried out.   \\n \\n(f) \\nDetailed briefing of departmental officers and sailors is to be \\ncarried out regarding the exercise and specific serials. Participation of \\nsailors in these briefing is of utmost importance for the smooth conduct \\nof the exercise. In case of longer exercises, ships should conduct daily \\nbriefing at sea for the concerned sailors regarding exercise programme/ \\nserials for the day.  \\n \\n(g) \\nAll other preparations for putting to sea, as per the Ships \\nStanding Orders, are to be carried out in time.  \\n \\n01008.   Post – Exercise Feed Back. \\n \\n(a) \\nGunnery Exercises. At the end of the ADX serial, ships are to \\nmake AIRDET signal as per format: -  \\n \\nFROM : SHIP  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPRIORITY  \\nTO       : OTC  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCONFIDENTIAL  \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \\nAIRDET (.)

Purpose.   This chapter contains exercises in Navigation and Direction. Its \\npurview, therefore, includes exercises for operational equipment checks, plotting/ \\npicture compilation, Plot/ data exchange, manoeuvring and aircraft control (including \\nUAV/ RPAs).  \\n \\n02002.    Coordination.   Some of the exercises require a degree of coordination with \\nother units and these are described in the instructions for each exercise. \\n \\n02003.    Responsibilities.   Details of responsibilities are laid down in individual \\nexercise instructions. \\n \\n02004.    Ordering.   Conduct of these exercises will be scheduled in the Deployment \\nProgramme by the OTC/ OCE.  \\n \\n02005.    Procedure.   Detailed procedures for conduct are described in each \\nexercise. The exercises being scheduled in a Deployment Programme should cater for \\nthe proficiency levels of the ship crews, starting with basic exercises and progressively \\ngraduating to more complicated/ advanced exercises. In case of a ship sailing after a \\nlong break/ layoff period, basic radar calibration exercises and equipment checks \\nshould be carried out prior moving on to more advanced serials. Plotting and picture \\ncompilation exercises should also be scheduled to ensure consolidation of crew \\nproficiency as well as equipment reliability.   \\n \\n02006.    Evaluation.   The evaluation of certain exercises such as equipment checks, \\ncalibration etc. are an internal matter for individual ships. Procedures for evaluation of \\nother exercises, and any reports required, are laid down in individual exercise \\ninstructions. \\n     \\n \\n                                                                               RESTRICTED                            INEXREM (ND) \\n \\n \\n \\nII-2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n02007.

Purpose.   \\nTo determine the correct value of the Radar Index Error of \\nsurveillance, navigational and weapon control radars of the ship. However, it is \\nprimarily conducted for Nav radars.   \\n \\n02023.    Situation.  \\nThis procedure is carried out independently by the ship, at sea \\nor in harbour.  \\n \\n02024.    Requirements. \\n \\n \\n(a) The time duration required to be considered for planning this exercise \\nwill usually be around 30 minutes. \\n \\n(b) No consorts are required. \\n \\n02025.    Procedure. \\n \\n(a) This includes the following procedures for radar calibration, as explained \\nin BR 45(1) Chapter 15:- \\n \\n(i) \\nChart method (in harbour). \\n \\n(ii) \\nTwo mark method (at sea). \\n \\n(iii) \\nThree mark method (at sea). \\n \\n(iv) \\nHSA Method (at sea). \\n \\n(b) Use of the Normal Chart.   If the ship is alongside in a harbour and \\nradar-conspicuous objects are available, then charted and radar ranges of \\nthe object may be compared. The difference is the index error. \\n \\n(c) \\nTwo-mark method.   The two-mark method may be used if two radar-\\nconspicuous objects are available, the range between them is known \\naccurately from the chart, and the ship is steaming between the marks. Radar \\nranges of both objects (A and B in Fig. 1 below) are taken simultaneously as \\nthe ship crosses the line between them. Both radar ranges include index error \\n     \\n \\n                                                                               RESTRICTED                            INEXREM (ND) \\n \\n \\n \\nII-9 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(IE). AB is the charted distance between the two objects; a is the radar range \\nbetween the ship and point A; b is the radar range between the ship and point \\nB. \\n \\n           a + IE + b + IE = AB \\n \\n           2 IE = AB - (a + b) \\n \\n           IE = [AB - (a + b)] / 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n                  Fig.1   Two Mark Method \\n \\n(d) Three-mark method. \\nWhen three radar-conspicuous and well \\ncharted objects are conveniently situated around the ship, radar ranges of all \\nthree objects may be taken simultaneously and range arcs from the objects \\ndrawn on the chart, producing a ‘radar cocked hat’, as shown in Fig. 2. The \\nindex error equals the radius of the circle drawn tangential to the three range \\narcs. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                   Fig.2  Three Mark Method \\n     \\n \\n                                                                               RESTRICTED                            INEXREM (ND) \\n \\n \\n \\nII-10 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(e) Horizontal Sextant Angle Method.   This method is carried out while \\nunderway and running on a transit with a third fixing mark available on the \\nbeam, as illustrated in the Figure below.  A table of true range of the radar \\nmark against sextant angle may be compiled in advance. Radar ranges are \\nread off as the horizontal sextant angle is measured. The differences \\nbetween true and radar range are then averaged to obtain the mean and the \\nindex error obtained. \\n \\n \\n \\nFig.3  HSA Method \\n \\n(f) \\nOn calculation of the Radar Index Error, the updated value must be \\nannotated on the respective radar displays, and a record maintained in ship’s \\nNDB. \\n \\n02026.    Co-ordinating Instructions.  This exercise may be carried out by a ship \\nindependently in harbour or at sea. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n                                                                               RESTRICTED                            INEXREM (ND) \\n \\n \\n \\nII-11 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n02027.    Safety Instructions. \\n \\n(a) Regular calibration of Radar Index Error (RIE) is essential, especially \\nafter a long lay-off/ refit. \\n  \\n(b) It is to be ensured that the relevant safety regulations with regards to \\nradar \\ntransmission \\nare \\nadhered \\nto, \\nand \\nappropriate \\n“cautionary \\nannouncements” are made as per extant orders. \\n \\n(c) \\nRIE needs to be calculated for different range scales on each display. \\n \\n02028.    Records/ Returns. \\n On calculation of RIE, the updated value must be \\nannotated on the respective radar displays, and a record maintained in ship’s NDB.  \\n \\n02029.

This procedure can be carried out by two ships in clear waters.  \\n \\n02032.    Requirements. \\n \\n \\n(a) Two ships. \\n \\n(b) The recommended time duration for this exercise is 30-45 minutes. \\n \\n(c) \\nThe fishing/ shipping traffic density should not be very high as this \\nprocedure requires the two ships to operate at close range.  \\n \\n02033.    Procedure. \\n \\n(a) The procedure for two-ship method for radar calibration is explained in \\nBR 45(1) Chapter 15. \\n \\n(b) The two-ship method involves the use of double echoes, which will \\nusually be produced by two ships proceeding in line abreast at close range. \\nThis is illustrated in the figure below.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFig. 4    Two ship Method \\n     \\n \\n                                                                               RESTRICTED                            INEXREM (ND) \\n \\n \\n \\nII-13 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(c) \\nRange A between own ship and the consort includes index error, but \\nrange B between the consort and the double echo does not. Thus, range B is \\nthe true range and the difference between this and the radar range A gives \\nthe index error. \\n \\n(d) Prior to commencement of the serial, the OTC is to ensure that the \\nparticipating ships are stationed at close range (5C for big ships/ 2.5C for \\nsmaller ships) in line abreast.  \\n \\n(e) Upon commencement, the OCS is to control the opening/ closing of the \\nships. Ships are to be closed till both ships get a double echo on their radar. \\n \\n(f) \\nBoth ships are to report on getting a double echo. \\n \\n(g) Radar Index Error is to be established independently by each ship.  \\n \\n02034.    Co-ordinating Instructions. \\n \\n \\n(a) Communication is to be established on V/UHF Radio to enable \\ncommunication regarding obtaining of double echo. \\n \\n(b) On completion, ships are to be opened again to the earlier range, as on \\ncommencement. OCS is to report to OTC when radar calibration is \\ncompleted. \\n \\n(c) \\nCalibration needs to be undertaken for each display for as many range \\nscales as feasible. \\n \\n02035.    Safety Instructions. \\n \\n(a) Regular calibration of Radar Index Error is essential, especially after a \\nlong lay-off/ refit.  \\n \\n(b) View close ranges, SSD is recommended to be closed up for this serial.  \\n \\n02036.    Records/ Returns. \\nEach ship is to report its RIE directly to the OTC.

All ships \\nare to establish communication on the designated V/UHF Radio circuit.  \\n \\n(f) \\nTabulated sheets indicating Radar Type, Pulse Length, Range Scale, \\nthe two radar ranges and the true range as applicable are to be made \\navailable at each display. \\n \\n(g) The OCS is to control the simultaneous recording of ranges by each \\nship in the promulgated ‘runs’. Each run may have up to 3 ‘cuts’ to average \\nout any aberration/ error in taking the readings. For example,  \\n \\n- \\nRun 1 (say, for 1.5 nm range scale).  \\n \\n- \\nOCS says, “Standby for Run 1/Cut 1… Now, Now, Now”. \\n \\n- \\nThe 2 wing ships record ranges of other 2 ships.  \\n \\n- \\nOperators must be briefed to strobe on the nearer end of the echo. \\n \\n- \\nA reports true range between B and C.

However, in the AAW exercises, the focus \\nis not on the Direction aspects, but on Fleet Anti-Air procedures, AMD actions, etc. The \\nrationale of having dedicated Direction Exercises is to ensure greater emphasis on air \\ndirection procedures and training of the Direction Officers. The detailed orders for \\nDIREX serials when in company of Aircraft Carrier will be issued by Direction team of \\nAircraft Carrier. Recommended sample signal format for SNAP SITs is placed at \\nAppendix ‘A’. \\n \\n \\nDIREX 01 - PRACTICE INTERCEPTIONS (PIs) \\n \\n \\n02133.

Content and Use.  This chapter provides introductory and explanatory \\nmaterial such as General Instructions and Guidelines for the conduct of exercises and \\nwhere appropriate, special safety precautions.  \\n \\n03002.   Command and Control. \\n   The duties of OSE, OCE, OTC and OCS have \\nbeen discussed in Section I, Chapter 1.   \\n \\n03003.   Communications.   Satisfactory conduct of an exercise depends on good \\ncommunications. Therefore, the OCE shall ensure that all communication \\npreparations have been made prior to the conduct of the exercise. The exercise must \\ninclude a suitable communication plan. The details of the circuits required by the \\nexercise should be covered in the briefing prior to the conduct of the exercise. A \\ngeneric complan for exercises is suggested at Appendix ‘A’ in addition to the \\nguidelines on various circuits explained in succeeding paragraphs.  \\n \\n \\nHF Communications  \\n \\n03004.   Use of HF Band.   Current restrictions on the use of ship HF especially            \\n8 MHz component in CW mode and Ship HF procedures as stipulated in NO ‘S’ 1/ 17 \\nChapter 3 and JSCP 8/ Chapter 10 is to be strictly adhered to. \\n \\n03005.   HF Silence at Sea.   The guidelines for breaking HF silence at sea, as laid \\ndown in current NO ‘S’ 1/17 (Article 0116) and those issued by NHQ and Command \\nHQs from time to time, are to be strictly adhered to. Commanding Officers are to \\nensure that their specific approval is taken prior to breaking HF R/T silence at sea. \\nReleasing of a message at sea is not to be construed as approval to break HF R/T \\nsilence. When operating in company, approval of the OTC is to be taken. \\n \\n03006.   HF Data Circuits. \\n   Exploitation of HF Data circuits during Operations/ \\nExercises other than War/ Precautionary Stage is to be undertaken as follows (not \\nwithin 500 Nm of Makran Coast in Arabian Sea): - \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                        RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-2 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(a) By Aircraft.   HF Data circuit shall be exploited by Aircraft for following \\nrequirements when out of V/ UHF radio range:- \\n \\n(i) \\nExchange of Routine communication with air station/ control \\nship/ SAR Ship at intervals not less than 15 mins. \\n \\n(ii) \\nDuring OTHT Procedure. \\n \\n(iii) \\nPlot Transmission to afloat unit/ MOC, at intervals not less than \\n15 mins. \\n \\n(b) By Submarine.   HF data circuit shall be exploited by Submarines for \\nfollowing requirements, other than forward deployed, as follows:- \\n \\n(i) \\nClear urgent traffic to SOA. \\n \\n(ii) \\nPlot Transmission to afloat units, MOC at intervals not less than \\n30 mins. \\n \\n(c) By Ships. \\nHF Data circuit shall be exploited by ships for following \\nrequirements, when beyond V/UHF radio range:- \\n \\n(i) \\nCommunication with MR Aircraft. \\n \\n(ii) \\nPlot Transmission to other ships/ aircraft/ MOC. \\n \\n(iii) \\nDuring OTHT Procedure. \\n \\n \\nSatellite Communication. \\n \\n03007.   Rukmani.   Exploitation of Rukmani is to be in accordance with current \\nNavy Order ‘S’ in force. The use of voice over Rukmani is to be regulated. VC is to be \\nused only with express permission of Commanding Officer. It is to be ensured that \\nover reliance on Rukmani is avoided and other circuits are amply used to maintain \\nredundancy. Op Authorities and individual units are to keep contingency plans ready \\nto be used during non-availability of Rukmani. The suggested contingency plan is \\nplaced at Appendix ‘B’. \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                        RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-3 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n03008.   INMARSAT.  \\nAs far as possible, all voice communication on \\nINMARSAT terminals is to be avoided. When used, all calls are to be authenticated \\nusing promulgated Caller IDs by Command Headquarters. INMARSAT is to be \\nexploited only on Indian LES. The use of INMARSAT services/ facilities is to be iaw \\nthe guidelines enumerated in NO(S) 14/2003. \\n \\n03009.   MSS (Gautam).   MSS is designated as the primary ship-shore circuit. \\nMSS Terminals with MSS message encryption unit (Gautam) are to be switched on \\nprior leaving harbour and switched off on securing alongside. Messages up to security \\nclassification SECRET can be exchanged enclair between Ship–Ship and Ship–\\nShore using Gautam. The delay upto four hours in delivery of messages is to be \\ncatered while passing messages over MSS. MSS MK II may be used by ships without \\nRukmani for voice communication with other units and shore authorities. \\nCOMNETCEN would acknowledge receipt of messages received from ships at sea \\non MSS.  \\n \\n03010.   UHF SATCOM. \\n Ships are to keep Satcom terminals ‘Switched ON’ and \\nremoted to RCU at Bridge at all times. The exploitation of UHF Satcom is to be \\nundertaken iaw Communication Acquaint 08/2014. \\n \\n03011.   Secure E-Mail (SECEM).    While e-mail is convenient, it is not an \\nestablished naval circuit and Communication Centers are not responsible for its \\nrouting to the destination. Ships are to use e-mail services over Rukmani and Gov \\nmail over Linux BOSS PCs through INMARSAT for exchanging SECEM. SECEM is \\nto be used for exchange of information viz., routine letters, reports, charts, drawings, \\ngraphic files. Uploading of photos/ large files is to be avoided.

Altering Course during Replenishment (Corpen N)  \\n \\n(a)  \\nDefinitions.  \\n \\n(i)  \\nReplenishing Unit.    A group of ships engaged in replenishment \\nwith one supplying ship, one or more receiving ships and ships in \\nwaiting station, including SAR ship. When ships of this unit are stationed \\nin a column, it may also be referred as the replenishment column.  \\n \\n(ii)  \\nControl Ship.   The ship controlling the UNREP operations of \\nthe replenishment unit is the Control Ship for that unit. Any alteration of \\ncourse shall be controlled by the control ship during Corpen ’N’. Duties \\nof Control ship are to be as follows :- \\n \\n(aa)   When replenishing from the Tanker.  \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n(aaa)  The Carrier replenishing alongside.  \\n \\n(aab)  When no Carrier is present in the replenishing unit, \\nthe Tanker.  \\n \\n(ab)  When one warship is replenishing from another.  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n(aaa)  The Carrier, if present.  \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n(aab)  If no Carrier is present, the Guide ship.  \\n   \\n(b)  \\nRate of Turn.    In all turns, the ships in replenishment unit are to be \\nguided by the rate of turn of the Control Ship.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                        RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-10 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(c)  \\nAction by OTC \\n \\n(i)  \\nThe OTC will use the group ‘Corpen N’ to order the alteration of \\ncourse for the whole formation. ‘Corpen N’ means that the replenishing \\nunits alter course when ordered by the Control Ship to the course \\nindicated to Port/ Starboard in steps of 5/ 10 degs as indicated. Ships in \\nthe replenishing column are to alter course preserving relative bearing \\nand distance. All other ships including ships on the screen are to alter \\ncourse preserving true bearings and distance.  \\n \\n(ii)  \\nCorpen N will be carried out by the delayed executive method. \\nThe OTC will execute Corpen N when all control ships have reported to \\nhim that their respective replenishing units are ready to turn. However, \\nif the OTC requires the units to turn as soon as possible, he may \\nexecute Corpen N before these reports are received.  \\n \\n(d)  \\nActions by Replenishing Unit  \\n \\n(i) \\nOn receipt of the signal “Execute to follow Corpen N’’, ships will \\nreport to the Control Ship of their respective replenishing unit on loud \\nhailer/ megaphone when they are ready for the alteration using the \\ngroup AF. Motorola and field telephone may also be used for the \\npurpose.  \\n \\n(ii)  \\nOn receipt of report ‘ready’, the control ship will in turn report to \\nthe OTC that the replenishing unit is ready for the alteration using the \\ngroup AF on Tactical Primary.  \\n \\n(iii)  \\nWhen Corpen N is executed by OTC, the control ship is to order \\nthe other ships of her replenishing unit to alter course by 5 degrees or \\n10 degs as specified by ordering on the motorola/ loud hailer ‘‘Stand by \\nto wheel over PORT/STBD to course-----”. On wheeling over, the guide \\nship is to indicate every degree change in ship’s head to the ships of \\nher replenishing group. The receiving ships are to repeat the same.  \\n \\n(iv)  \\nThe guide ship signals ‘Wheel Over’ by one (starboard) or two \\n(port) short blasts on the siren.  \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                        RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-11 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(v)  \\nOn completion of each step, ships are to indicate readiness for \\nthe next step of alteration, by the group AF on the loudhailer/ \\nmegaphone/ Motorola/ field telephone to control ship.  \\n \\n(vi)  \\nOn reaching the new course ordered, the control ship is to report \\nto the OTC using the group AB on the Tactical Primary.  \\n \\n(vii) \\nWhen a replenishment unit consists of more than one unit, units \\nreporting readiness by AF, should be made from stbd, port and then \\nastern to obviate any errors in reception.  \\n \\n03035.   Disengaging Procedure.    The following disengagement procedure is to be \\nfollowed during various types of UNREPs: - \\n \\nSer \\nType of UNREP \\nType of Disengagement \\n(a)  \\nSKBDL \\nOn order from OTC/ OCS \\n(b)  \\nRASAPS \\nOn order from OTC/ OCS \\n(c)  \\nUNREP (Abeam/ Astern) -  Top \\nup and Token fuelling \\nAutomatic \\n(d)  \\nLight Line Transfer \\nAutomatic \\n(e)  \\nLight/ Heavy Jackstay \\nAutomatic \\n(f)  \\nUNREP/ Jackstay (Light/ Heavy) \\nfor shop window \\nOn order from OTC/ OCS \\n(g)  \\nPractice Picking Up Float (PPF) \\nOn order from OTC/ OCS \\n \\n* During emergency breakaway, no ceremonials are to be carried out.  \\n \\n03036.

The following are essential: - \\n \\n(a) Strict adherence to the assigned frequency.  \\n \\n(b) Distress or emergency frequencies are not to be used for operator \\ntraining. \\n \\n(c) Ships are not to use more than 50 Watt on HF circuit for exercises \\nconducted in harbour. \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                        RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-17 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(d) While ordering circuit, due consideration should be given to the \\nappropriate security restrictions prevailing. \\n \\n(e) Efforts should also be made to make use of the unused frequencies, \\nwhich are cleared for use, as and when feasible.  \\n \\n03047.   Exercise Messages.    Messages transmitted for exercises are to be \\nidentified as follows: - \\n \\n \\n(a) The word ‘Drill’ will be included as the first and last word of the text of \\nall plain language messages. In case of encrypted/ encoded messages, the \\nword ‘Drill’ will appear as the first word of the encrypted/ encoded text, i.e. \\ncryptogram. \\n \\n(b) The exercise messages for crypto practice should have word ‘Crypto \\nDrill’ encrypted as the first word of the encrypted text. \\n \\n \\n03048.   Flag Signals.    Flag signals hoisted for exercises are to be preceded by flag \\n‘SIERRA’ hoisted singly in a superior position and kept flown throughout the exercise. \\nIf it is necessary to transmit an operational message during a flag hoist signal, \\n‘SIERRA’ is to be hauled down and the operational signal hoisted after ensuring that \\nall ships have also hauled down ‘SIERRA’. \\n \\n \\n03049.   Manoeuvring Board. \\nSome of the exercises are designed to provide \\ntraining in manoeuvering through the use of plotting/ manoeuvering with small metal/ \\nwooden model ships on the manoeuvering board. For such exercise, the types of \\nforces are assumed to be either of the following: - \\n \\n(a) \\nShips taking part, organised as ordered before or at the beginning of \\nthe exercise, or \\n \\n(b) \\nTwelve ships in 3 divisions and 6 sub-divisions in column in the order of \\nsequence number, steering 000 degrees at 15 knots. OTC/ GUIDE is \\nsequence number 5. \\n \\n03050.   Exercise Reports. \\nAfter \\ncommunication \\nexercises \\nhave \\nbeen \\nconducted, the conducting unit is to prepare a report of exercise, giving detailed \\ncomments. These reports are to be disseminated to participating units, the Officer \\nScheduling Exercise (OSE) and other authorities as appropriate.

Any conflict in the future will be increasingly dependent on the use of \\nadvanced state of art weapon systems, all of which would operate within the \\nelectromagnetic spectrum. All efforts should, therefore, be made to exploit the \\nelectromagnetic spectrum to our own advantage. These efforts would come \\nunder the purview of Electronic Warfare, which is an important factor in the \\nmilitary equation and has demonstrated its vital influence on battlefield \\ndecisions, at the tactical as well as at the operational and strategic levels. To \\nensure optimum utilisation of the EM spectrum and to harness the full potential \\nof EW activities, it is essential that ships are maintained at their best material \\nand personnel readiness for all EW activities. The ships therefore, need to be \\nregularly exercised at various EW exercises to keep the crew professionally \\ncompetent.  \\n \\n03053.   The succeeding paragraphs are promulgated to standardise the EW \\nexercises and address the related issues of EW organisation, EW – AIO \\nintegration, EW practices at sea, maintenance of data integrity, EW returns, \\nequipment maintenance, training and action post. Certain guidelines for the \\nsame are enumerated in the succeeding paragraphs. \\n \\n \\nOrganisational Issues  \\n \\n03054.   EMCON in Vicinity of Foreign Ships.   Ships are to comply with \\ninstructions laid down by Commands regarding restrictive operations of radars \\nin the vicinity of visiting foreign ships. Laid down measures are to be taken when \\n‘Mehman’ and ‘Trader’ are in force.  \\n \\n03055.   RADHAZ Organisation.   The ships are to promulgate RADHAZ \\norganisation measures i.a.w. current regulations in order to prevent radiation \\nhazard to personnel, fuel and ordnance related incidents. Regular training is to \\nbe conducted to enhance personnel awareness on radio hazards and \\nprecautions thereof. \\n \\n                                                     RESTRICTED                      \\nINEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-26 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n03056.   Communication Security Policy.     Unless otherwise ordered, CSP 2 \\nis always to be in force in the Fleet during peacetime operations.  \\n \\n03057.   Conduct of EW Activity.   Link II/ EW Flicknet circuit is to be used for \\nthe conduct of all inter-ship EW activity.  \\n \\n03058.   Chaff Policy.   Ships are to have a comprehensive chaff exploitation \\ndoctrine together with command and control orders for firing in each mode. The \\npolicy pertaining to each ship is to be incorporated in the ship’s EW Standing \\nOrders. The policy is to keep the physical/ technical limitations of Chaff Systems \\nin consideration while formulating the chaff dispensation policy for AMD. The \\nchaff firing drill is to be regularly exercised during CRC/ bridge emergency drills. \\n \\n03059.   Damage to ESM Equipment.  Ships are not to operate their ESM \\nsystems while transmitting on own ships radar if radar blanking is not effective \\nor when ships in close proximity are operating high power radars.  \\n \\n \\nEW – AIO Integration   \\n \\n03060.   In order to achieve optimal exploitation of EW assets, the EW efforts \\nneed to be fully integrated with AIO. EW operator in the ship should exchange \\ninformation with ORO and OOW. The EW Flick information must be exchanged \\namongst ships of the fleet towards development of correct tactical AIO picture.  \\n \\n03061.   Intra-Ship-EW-AIO Integration.  \\n \\n(a) EW Post should have good co-ordination and effective two-way \\nexchange of information with Bridge and Ops Room.  \\n \\n(b) Bridge is to update EW Post on changes in the formation of own \\nunits/ disposition of friendly units.  \\n \\n(c) \\nIMSAS display is to be available in the EW office to ensure that \\nthe EW operator is aware of the prevailing situation and the disposition \\nof ships. The node should be an active one to facilitate plotting of EW \\nbearings for effective triangulation. \\n \\n(d) \\nThe EW operator is responsible to provide relevant ESM inputs to \\nOps Room for updating the plots.  \\n \\n                                                     RESTRICTED                      \\nINEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-27 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(e) \\nThe EW operator is to obtain visual identification of all the ESM \\nintercepts from the Bridge, when in range.  \\n \\n(f) \\nOOW is to ensure that ESM intercepts received on TP, having \\ntactical relevance, are intimated to the EW Post/ Flag Bridge and Ops \\nRoom.  \\n \\n(g) \\nOOW is to ensure that information pertaining to the anticipated \\nlocation of friendly units/ neutrals/ adversaries held by the Bridge is \\nshared with EW Office.  \\n \\n03062.   Inter-Ship EW-AIO Organisation.   While routine EW information may \\ncontinue to be exchanged between Ops Room/ EW Posts on the Link II - EW \\nFLICK, reports made on the TP must have undergone an appropriate level of \\nonboard analysis and co-relation.  \\n \\n(a) Important intercepts of tactical relevance are to be reported on the \\nTP in the form of emergency alarm signals/ ECR. In addition, an \\namplifying report is to be made on the Link II - EW FLICK, indicating \\nthe identity of the emitter or the Hammer Number assigned, if the \\nidentity is not established.  \\n \\n(b) Ships are to monitor this report and search for the intercept. Ships \\nobtaining an intercept with the bearing of the same emitter are to report \\nthe same, indicating the bearing of the intercept/ hammer.  \\n \\n(c) If any other ship has achieved classification using an on/ off line \\nELINT library, the same is to be reported to the OTC.  \\n \\n(d) Flick Net.  \\nThe Link II - EW FLICK is to be used for exchange \\nof flick reports. Unless otherwise ordered by the OTC, when beyond \\nV/ UHF range/ Link II (HF)/ Link II (Rukmani) may be used for both EW \\ncontrol and for flick reporting.  \\n \\n(e)  Ships are to carry out plot transfer of own position and EW \\nintercept using IMSAS. The maximum time for air and surface \\nintercepts are to be 30 min and two hrs respectively. The designation \\non IMSAS is to be iaw respective fleet orders. The suggestive way is \\n- SVL0900-I-P3C meaning Shivalik intercepted I band at 0900 of P3C.   \\n \\n(f) All available opportunities are to be utilised for establishing the \\nRange Advantage Factor (RAF) of an ESM system.  \\n                                                     RESTRICTED                      \\nINEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-28 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n \\n03063.    EW Reporting Procedures.    The code words, abbreviations and \\nthe amplifying data with their meanings to be used for EW intercepts are laid \\ndown in Chapter VII of INCB 12(A)/ 94 and JSCP 2. The procedure formulated \\nvide FOST letter 307/1 dated 14 Sep 04 for reporting EW intercepts is \\nenumerated below for compliance. Handling of IDR/ MTR signals is to be as per \\norders issued by command.  \\n \\n(a) \\nConfidence Level.  \\nConfidence level is to be classified as \\nHigh, Moderate and Low based on following: -  \\n \\n(i)             High.   An ESM intercept will be classified as ‘High’ \\nif any one or more of the following criteria are met: -  \\n \\n(aa)  ESM intercept matches with those which \\nhave been visually correlated earlier by own/ any \\nother unit.  \\n \\n(ab)  At least one more ESM intercept of a second \\nradar from the same platform and from the same \\ndirection matches closely with parameters validated \\npreviously.  \\n \\n(ii)  \\nModerate. An ESM intercept will be classified \\n‘Moderate’ when parameters match closely with those \\ncontained in ship’s ELINT data book or INTEG ELINT \\ndatabase with at least one more corroborating factor: -  \\n \\n(aa)  A V/ UHF intercept obtained simultaneously.  \\n \\n(ab)  Surface/ sub surface/ air tactical plots and \\ngeographical positioning indicating the presence.  \\n \\n(ac)  Situational \\nawareness/ \\nintelligence \\nco-\\nrelating indicating presence.  \\n \\n(iii)  \\nLow.    An ESM intercept will be classified ’Low’ \\nwhen appreciation is based purely on matching of parameters \\ncontained in EWOSC data base/ ELINT library onboard with \\nreasonable similarity.  \\n \\n                                                     RESTRICTED                      \\nINEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-29 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(b)  \\nFormat for Reporting.   The ship intercepting a transmission is \\nto make an ‘Alarm Report’ to all ships. The following format for reporting \\nEW intercept is to be followed: -    \\n \\n(i) \\nOn Link II - TP.  The first report is made using alarm \\nprocedure when the confidence level is high.  \\n \\n(aa) Collective de Ship = Emergency I - Bearing, \\nAppreciate (Identity) Desig HH (Number) = (Time of \\nintercept).  \\n \\n(ab)  Collective de Ship = WMI 51/52/53 (Bearing and \\nBand), Appreciate (Call sign or Identity) - Desig \\nHH(Number)=(Time).  \\n \\n(ac)    Further Steering/ DF reports by units are to be made \\non EW Flick net to EWCS for locating position of \\nintercepted transmission using triangulation method.  \\n \\n(ii)  \\nOn CIP / Flick Net.  \\n  The report is made when confidence \\nlevel is moderate/ low.  \\n \\nCollective de Ship = WMI 51/52/53 (Bearing and Band), \\nAppreciate (Identity) Desig Confidence level Moderate or \\nLow – HH (Number) = (Time).  \\n \\n(c)  \\nIntercept Reports.   In case of communication intercept, ship \\noriginating the flick report should pass on EW intercept information, \\nwhich will assist other operators in finding the victim transmitter. This \\ninformation to other ships is to be passed in the form of frequent and brief \\nreport known as ‘Steering Report’. These reports consist of only the \\nHammer (HH) number followed by the steering information. If EWCS \\norders to ‘Account’ a particular intercept, all available units having DF \\ncapability are to pass their report to EWCS.  \\n \\nSteering Report. “Collective de Ship = V/UHF/ HF Comint on \\nbearing ____(if DF available) App_____ = (Time)”.  \\n \\n03064.   EWCS.  \\nUnless otherwise promulgated, Flag ship/ OTC will be \\nEWCS. The EWCS, who is responsible for the control of the electromagnetic \\nenvironment, is also to ensure that the EW and AIO efforts of the force are \\n                                                     RESTRICTED                      \\nINEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-30 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\nintegrated at all levels and all times. In essence, the EWCS is responsible to the \\nOTC for the following: -  \\n \\n(a) \\nEnsure proper EES measures being adhered to by the ships.  \\n \\n(b) \\nAct as EEP regulatory ship and ensure strict compliance of the \\nEMCON policy in force by all units in company, including integral aircraft.  \\n \\n(c) \\nRecord the duct data influenced frequencies and geographical \\nposition of the ship using AREPS prediction/ assessment aids.  \\n \\n(d) \\nCarry out/ nominate ships in company to carryout random \\nmonitoring of all friendly communication circuits, including HF, air circuits \\netc to ensure that: -  \\n \\n(i) \\nAll units, including integral/ co-operating aircraft, strictly \\nadhere to the CSP in force.  \\n \\n(ii) \\nAll units implement adequate EES measures on all radio \\ncircuits, including hand held walkie-talkies, where classified \\ninformation is liable to be exchanged in plain language.  \\n \\n(e) \\nCollect, classify and evaluate all radar and communication \\nintercepts obtained by friendly units. EWCS is to carry out plotting to \\nestimate the emitter position (by triangulation) and promulgate the \\nestimated position to all ships in company on Link II - EW FLICK.  \\n \\n(f) \\nImplement the ESM search task (on all bands) as promulgated by \\nthe OTC.  \\n \\n(g) \\nAssist the OTC in controlling ship-borne radar/ communication \\njamming and deception efforts, if so directed.  \\n \\n \\n \\nEW Practices at Sea  \\n \\n03065.   Formulation of EMCON.    Senior ship/ ships operating independently \\nis/ are to lay down an unambiguous EMCON policy. The OTC is to be guided \\nby principles laid out in relevant tactical publications (INEWIS) whilst formulating \\nEMCON policy. Following guidelines are pertinent: -  \\n \\n(a) \\nAnomalous propagation conditions. \\n  \\n \\n                                                     RESTRICTED                      \\nINEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-31 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(b) \\nESM equipped MR aircraft may be operating from airfields of \\nneighbouring countries.  \\n \\n(c) \\nProficiency of operators in building surface pictures by carrying \\nout limited sweeps on radars. \\n \\n03066.   EMCON Policy.    Whilst specific EMCON policy will be laid down in \\nthe operations/ exercise orders, general guidelines on EMCON for units are as \\nfollows: - \\nSer \\nRadars \\nRemarks \\n(a) \\nC/D \\nband \\nradars \\nOperation by single unit, except during flying \\noperations, AD and tracking exercises. Otherwise, \\nit is to be operated iaw the Guard roster \\npromulgated in the exercise orders/ by ARRCS.  \\n(b) \\nE/F \\nband \\nradars \\nTo be used during surface engagement serials and \\nsurface shoots. Otherwise, it is to be operated iaw \\nthe Guard roster promulgated in the exercise \\norders/ by SRRCS. May be used for navigation \\npurposes by single unit in the absence of any other \\naids, for collision avoidance.  \\n(c) \\nI band \\nnavigational/  \\nsurveillance \\nradars  \\nTactical.  \\n(d) \\nE/ F/ I band \\nCOTS radars \\nUnrestricted.  \\n(e) \\nTracking/ FC \\nradars  \\nFor ADX/ tracking/ weapon firing serials. Otherwise \\nsilence.  \\n(f) \\nAircraft/ Helo \\nradars  \\nTo be specifically authorised keeping in mind the \\nmission, tactical situation and overall EMCON. \\nAircraft to open out to at least 30 nm when on a \\nradar probe before operating her radars.  \\n(g) \\nRadio \\ntransmission  \\nRadio sets are to be utilized with Link II to the \\nextent feasible. If requirement exists to transmit on \\nR/T, V/UHF radios may be operated as per Tactical \\nand HF radios only as per occasions to break HF \\nsilence as laid out in current NO’S’ 1.   \\n(h) \\nMF Tx \\nTactical \\n(j) \\nSonars   \\nTactical.  \\n                                                     RESTRICTED                      \\nINEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-32 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n03067.   Electronic \\nEmission \\nSecurity \\n(EES). \\nTo \\nensure \\nminimum \\nintelligence being obtained by the enemy, some of the EES measures which \\nshould be undertaken by the units of Fleet are mentioned below: -  \\n \\n(a)  Random change of frequencies and callsigns.  \\n \\n(b) Use   of   minimum power   as deemed   necessary to   reach the \\nintended recipient.  \\n \\n(c) Directional/ sector transmission for radars.  \\n \\n(d) Transmitting only when necessary and for as short a time as \\npossible. Use of DCT/ speech secrecy units whenever possible.  \\n \\n(e) Maintenance of circuit discipline and no excessive tuning and \\ntesting of transmitters.  \\n \\n(f) Use of authentication on important circuits and for important \\nmessages.  \\n \\n03068.   AREPS. \\nOn receipt of upper air atmospheric data, all ships should \\ngenerate Vertical Coverage Diagram (VCD) and Propagation Range Diagram \\n(PRD) of own surveillance radars daily using the Advanced Refractive Effects \\nPrediction System (AREPS) program or similar software if available. These are \\nto be available in the Bridge and Ops room for perusal by the Captain, ORO and \\noperators of radars. In case of non availability of ship with UASS, ships are to \\ngenerate VCD and PRD based on standard atmospheric data. ORO is to ensure \\nthat the actual radar ranges are recorded and AREPS data is validated by \\ncomparing the recorded ranges with the predicted ranges and a summary of the \\nanalysis is to be included in the EW analysis forwarded to EWOSC. \\n \\n03069.   SHF DF Watch.    At sea, ships are to keep continuous SHF DF \\nwatch and attempt classification of all intercepts. All ELINT is to be recorded, \\nwhere facilities for recording exist, important parameters are to be recorded. \\nWhere identity of the emitter is obtained, the same is to be indicated.  \\n \\n03070.   HF/ V/UHF Tasks.    Search tasks for ships will be promulgated through \\ndeployment orders. Ships are to set watch accordingly, with emphasis on \\n(k) \\nEcho \\nsounder  \\nUnrestricted  \\n(l) \\nUWT  \\nUnrestricted  \\n                                                     RESTRICTED                      \\nINEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-33 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\nspecifically allotted frequencies. Important COMINT intercepts are to be \\nrecorded.  \\n \\n03071.   Use of V/UHF Search Receivers.    V/UHF search receivers are to be \\nused only for intercept purposes. These sets are not to be used for helo \\noperations and on other occasions regarding tape recording of communications.  \\n \\n03072.   ECM Tasks.    Effectiveness of radar jamming is a function of range \\nbetween the two platforms. Efforts need to be made to programme frequent \\njamming exercises to evaluate the efficacy of radar jamming. However, as \\nencounters at sea normally take place at extended ranges, radar jamming by \\nship–borne equipment may either not be employed or be partially effective. \\nJamming as an AMD measure is to be exercised regularly.  \\n \\n03073.   Communication Jamming.   All ships should have their jamming \\norganisation ready at short notice whenever at sea. Each ship will have to work \\nout her organisation and lay down orders for tuning of the most powerful \\ntransmitter on each band and remoting it to a suitable user position. Pre-\\nrecorded jamming signals played back at maximum volume are most effective \\nand are to be prepared and kept ready.  \\n \\n \\nMaintenance of Data Integrity  \\n \\n03074.   Maintenance of the ELINT Data Book.  The data book is to be \\nupdated and maintained by all ships fitted with EW equipment. This book is to \\nbe classified SECRET.  \\n \\n03075.   Handling of Ship’s ELINT Data Book.    In view of the highly sensitive \\ndata contained in the book, the following procedure is to be strictly complied \\nwith: -  \\n \\n(a) \\nThe book is to be kept in the personal custody of SCO/ EWO. \\n  \\n(b) \\nUpdating of the book is to be undertaken only by the \\ncommunication branch (EW) sailors in the EW Office, as stipulated by \\nINCB 12A/ 94.  \\n \\n(c) \\nMonthly signature of the Commanding Officer is to be obtained \\npersonally by the SCO/ EWO or by senior EW sailor.  \\n \\n                                                     RESTRICTED                      \\nINEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-34 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n03076.   Security of EWOSC ELINT Libraries.    E-Searcher (ELINT library) \\nand ELINT Data Book have been issued by EWOSC to all operational \\nformations. These publications have been accorded the status of a SECRET \\nCB and their security and safe custody is to be ensured.  \\n \\n03077.   Safe Custody and Destruction of EW Logs.   EW/ COMINT Log \\n(NC18/18A) contain information pertaining to intercepted emitter parameters \\nand are therefore a repository of highly classified material. Ships are to take \\nthem on charge and keep them under safe custody. On completion of every \\nsortie, ESM intercepts of relevance are to be immediately transcribed from the \\nEW Log to the ship’s ELINT Data Book. Thereafter, these logs are to be retained \\nonboard for a period of 12 months and are to be destroyed at the end of this \\nperiod iaw Art 229 (a) of NO ‘S’ 3/05. Ships are required to maintain a register \\nto record certificates of destruction, which should be signed by a board of two \\nofficers.  \\n \\n \\nGeneral Points  \\n \\n03078.   Evaluation of EW Sensors.  \\nEvaluation of EW sensors is an \\nimportant activity. When ships/ aircraft effect R/V, they are to record the \\nmaximum ESM intercept ranges. Results of these trials are to be exchanged \\nwith other units as per formats issued by respective op authorities. \\n \\n03079.   Equipment Calibration/ Trials.   Calibration of EW equipment is to be \\nundertaken:-  \\n \\n(a) On initial installation. \\n \\n(b) Modification/any change in outdoor/ indoor unit. \\n \\n(c) \\nAfter a Major Refit. \\n \\n03080.   Sensitivity of ESM.   Ships are to ensure that sensitivity checks, as \\nlaid down in system technical documents and whenever the detection ranges \\nare unusually less, are carried out to ensure detection ranges commensurate \\nwith the expected ranges at all times.  \\n \\n03081.   Bearing Accuracy Checks.    Ships are to carry out bearing accuracy \\nchecks, once in a quarter and ensure that correction graphs are available in the \\nEW Office. The EW operator should report the bearing after applying the \\ncorrection to the Bridge/ Command.  \\n                                                     RESTRICTED                      \\nINEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-35 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n03082.   ECM.    Concerted efforts are to be made to maintain ECM systems in \\nan operational state. Efficacy of radar jamming of various target platforms is to \\nbe monitored and recorded. Optimum jamming programmes against specific \\nthreat radars are to be identified and recorded.  \\n \\n03083.   Co-relation and Evaluation of Intercepts.    SCOs/ EWOs of the \\nships are personally responsible for the training of ESM operators on the \\nprocess of co-relation/ evaluation of the ESM intercepts. Identifying intercepts \\ninstantaneously is an operator skill that results from concerted training.  \\n \\n03084.   Conduct of EW Exercises.    EW exercises and procedures of their \\nconduct are promulgated through INEWIS (INCB 213). INEWIS may be referred \\nfor EW exercises.  The procedure for conduct of various EW exercises is laid \\ndown in INCB 213 (INEWIS - 2014) promulgated by NHQ and is to be strictly \\nadhered to. Correct maintenance of all records is vital to performance analysis.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                    RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-36 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\nCHAPTER – 3  \\n \\n \\nNETWORK CENTRIC WARFARE \\n \\n \\n03085.   Introduction.    Nature of warfare is undergoing a major transformation \\ndue to growing Network Centric Warfare (NCW) capabilities. NCW is the \\nproduct of convergence of certain key technologies such as computers, \\ncommunications, sensors and precision fires – and their exploitation to bring to \\nbear maximum combat power at the right place at the right time. NCO has also \\nbeen described as high tempo, precise, agile style of manoeuvre warfare \\nfocused on Effects Based Operations (EBO) that derives their power from \\nrobust networking of geographically separated entities. \\n \\n03086.   NCO.   Network Centric Operations (NCO) have gained enormous \\nsignificance in the recent past and are intrinsic to operational deployment of \\nFleet units. The object of NCO is to seamlessly exchange tactical information in \\norder to ensure an updated real-time tactical picture, for facilitating collaborative \\nengagements by fleet units. With the advancement in IT field, NCO has got the \\nnecessary impetus and there is a need to harness COTS technology to meet \\nfuturistic battlefield requirements.   \\n \\n03087.   NCO Organistion.    In order to provide necessary impetus to NCO of \\nFleet and to implement NCO initiatives, a core team needs to be setup onboard \\nships and Fleet headquarters. The charter of duties of various officers in order \\nto have an effective Network Centric Organisation onboard are enumerated in \\nthe succeeding paragraphs: - \\n \\n(a) \\nNCO Officer (NCOO).   The NCOO of the ship is the overall \\ncoordinator of all NCO related aspects onboard. He should not only keep \\nhimself abreast of all developments in the field of NCO, but should also \\nbe conversant with all NCO related issues/ activities onboard. He must \\nenable and oversee the optimal exploitation of the ship’s NCO setup in \\norder to maintain an updated real-time tactical picture at sea so that the \\nships maintain optimum inter-ship coordination and a collaborative \\nengagement capability. This duty should ideally be handled by EWO or \\nSCO. \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                    RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-37 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(b) \\nNavigating Officer. \\n    The NO is responsible for ensuring timely \\nupdate of plots and reporting of received data and plot. He ensures that \\nthe plot on IMSAS is always updated and is being transmitted at regular \\nintervals as per existing orders. \\n \\n(c) \\nSignal Communication Officer.    The SCO is responsible for \\nprovision of the various circuits/ connectivity with units/ shore stations. \\nHe is to ensure proper and reliable external (radio and satellite) \\nconnectivity for seamless exchange of information whilst ensuring \\ninformation security onboard with respect to NCO. \\n \\n(d) \\nDLO/ ALO (NDC).  DLO/ ALO (NDC) is responsible for \\nmaintenance and operations of system interface used in NCO. He \\nensures reliable and efficient operation of all interface of equipment/ \\nsystem hardware of NCO. \\n \\n(e) \\nITO. ITO onboard would be responsible for Maintenance and \\nupkeep of infrastructure created for MDA and AIO LAN including PC and \\nperipherals used for MDA. \\n \\n03088.   NCO Nets.   The following NCO enabling circuits are to be manned by \\nthe ships at sea at all times:- \\n \\n(a) \\nIMSAS - MSS.   MSS is the primary means of sending plot to MOC \\nfrom ships at sea. Only the designated NCO frequency of MSS is to be \\nused for plot transfer. Similarly, MSS plot broadcast radiated by \\nrespective MOCs enables ships at sea to receive the COP generated at \\nCommand Op Centre. Units proceeding to sea are to ascertain two-way \\nplot exchange with MOC (V) on this circuit prior cast off. IMSAS-Link II – \\nRukmani is alternate plot transfer circuit and is to be continuously \\nmanned at all times. \\n \\n(b) \\nIMSAS-Link II-Rukmani.   This would be primary means of \\nexchange of plots between ships fitted with Rukmani. Also, the plots may \\nbe exchanged with MOC over this circuit. Units are to ensure that revisit \\ntime of surface and air plots is to be such that it does not unnecessarily \\nclogs the Rukmani network. A revisit time of 300 sec for surface and 30 \\nsec for air plot is recommended.  \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                    RESTRICTED                      INEXREM (COM) \\n \\n \\nIII-38 \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(c) \\nIMSAS - Link II - RF.   IMSAS-Link II-RF will be used in case of \\nnon-availability of IMSAS-Link II-Rukmani circuit. Units are to ensure that \\nthis circuit is checked with other units prior proceeding to sea. It is also \\nto be ensured that concurrent operation with IMSAS-Link II-Rukmani is \\navoided. This circuit can be used both over V/UHF while in coverage and \\nover HF radios while out of coverage of V/UHF radios. \\n \\n(d)      IBA Plots over VLF.  The integrated broadcast Application has \\nthe facility to receive plots over VLF which is integrated to IMSAS \\ninfrastructure onboard. This would be primary circuit for plot broadcast \\nby MOC in case of non-availability of Satcom.  \\n \\n03089.   NCX (Network Centric Exercise).   The conduct of network centric \\nexercises is to be programmed during ships’ deployments. The various NCX \\nwhich have been conceptualised are as follows:-  \\nExercise \\nAim \\nProcedure \\nNCX1 \\nExchange of text \\nmessages between \\nunits on Link II  V/ \\nUHF \\n1.

Various requirements of Sea Echelon \\nmethod are enumerated in succeeding paragraphs.  \\n \\n(b) \\nNGS Areas. NGS areas can be divided into three areas: - \\n \\n(i) \\nSea Echelons. \\nAn \\narea \\nwhere \\nships \\nare \\nrequired to maintain keeping clear from enemy fire in a safe \\nheaven. This area is located seaward to the waiting area.   \\n \\n(ii) \\nWaiting Area (WA). \\nAn area where ships are \\nrequired to prepare for carrying out NGFS shoot and is \\nlocated seaward of fire support area. Ships are required to \\nprepare their gun mounts and Fire Control Radars for \\nengagement in this area  \\n \\n(iii) \\nFire Support Area (FSA).  \\nAn \\narea \\nwhere \\nships are required to carry out bombardment in support of \\namphibious \\noperation. \\nShips \\nare \\nindependent \\nto \\nmanoeuvre in the Fire Support Area.  \\n \\n(c) \\nProcedure. \\n \\n(i) \\nAll participating ships should reach respective sea \\nechelon area by a particular promulgated time. \\n \\n \\n                                                  RESTRICTED                          INEXREM (GUN)                   \\n \\n \\nIV-65 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n \\n(ii) \\nOTC will order first firing ship to proceed to waiting \\narea and prepare for engagement. Target data in terms of \\ngeographic position (Latitude-Longitude) must be provided \\nwhile the ship is in waiting area. Ship should prepare and \\nbe ready in all respect for engagement at waiting area.  \\n \\n(iii) \\nOTC will order first firing ship to proceed to Fire \\nSupport Area and commence engagement. On this order \\nfirst firing ship to proceed to FSA and second firing ship \\nshould move to waiting area and wait for first firing ship to \\nclear FSA. \\n \\n(iv) \\nWithin FSA, firing ship will be independent to \\nmanoeuvre as required and undertaken the engagement of \\nthe target.  \\n \\n(v) \\nIn practice, errors of the day would be computed \\naway from the Amphibious Objective Area (AOA), where \\nenemy fire is unlikely.  \\n \\n(vi) \\nIn the exercise scenario, error of the day would be \\ncomputed by firing on the shore target as hitherto, with \\nWarmer, Observatory and Confirmatory shots by all \\nparticipating units.  \\n \\n(vii) \\nSpotting Helo/ spotting observer would provide fall of \\nshots for Observatory, Confirmatory and FFE. \\n \\n(viii) \\nOTC/ OCS can change target data during the \\nengagement based on the input from troops being \\nsupported. Therefore, allowing the target, latitude and \\nlongitude to be changed during the NGFS procedure.  \\n \\n(ix) \\nOn completion of engagement, first firing ship will \\nreport firing completed and automatically move out of the \\nFSA and then return to her sea echelon area. \\n \\n(x) \\nSecond firing ship will automatically move to FSA on \\ncompletion of engagement by first firing ship and \\ncommence bombardment.  \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                  RESTRICTED                          INEXREM (GUN)                   \\n \\n \\nIV-66 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(xi) \\nThe process will continue till bombardment by last \\nship of the formation completed.  \\n \\n(xii) \\nShip experiencing misfire to move to a specific area \\n“Misfire Area” and carry out the misfire drill.

As per Regs Navy Part 1, art 2729 and as general \\npractice in IN, Junior Sailors are accommodated in messes according to \\nbraches wherever possible and Senior Sailors of all braches accommodated in \\nmesses according to rank. Any damage sustained by a mess will lead to \\nmultiple casualties from a single department which may affect the war waging \\ncapability of the ship. Though, the department wise distribution of messes may \\nnot apply for ships of size of missile corvettes and below, the effects on larger \\ncombatants are profound. Sailors of different departments may be \\naccommodated across the messes so that damage to a single mess does not \\naffect manpower availability of a particular department. A mechanism is \\ntherefore required to be worked out to allocate manpower from different \\ndepartments in common messes. This method of messing may be termed as \\n“Battle Messing Plan”. This Gunnery exercise is intended to train the ship’s \\ncompany in assuming battle messing when proceeding to sea during higher \\nstates of readiness/ conflict. The rationale of these exercises is to provide \\naccommodation in such a way so that manpower availability of a single \\ndepartment is not adversely affected in case a particular mess sustains battle \\ndamage. \\n \\n \\nMESSEX 01 \\n \\nASSUMING BATTLE MESSING PLAN DURING  \\nHEIGHTENED READINESS STATES/ HOSTILITIES/ PANDEMIC \\n \\n \\n04179. \\nPurpose. \\n \\n \\n(a) \\n  To exercise ships company to assume Battle Messing Plan when \\nproceeding to sea during higher states of readiness/ conflict/ pandemic \\nsituations. \\n \\n(b) \\n  Devise specific SOPs to seamlessly shift between normal messing \\nand battle messing. \\n \\n04180. Situation. \\nThe ship is proceeding to sea during higher states of \\nreadiness/ conflict situation. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                  RESTRICTED                          INEXREM (GUN)                   \\n \\n \\nIV-118 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n04181. \\nRequirements. \\n \\n \\n(a) \\nAvailability of department wise numbers of personnel in each \\nmess. \\n \\n(b) \\nTotal number of bunks available in each mess. \\n \\n(c) \\nWatch and Station Bill of the ship. \\n \\n(d) \\nDetails of sections in which messes and action posts are located. \\n \\n04182. \\nProcedure. \\n \\n(a) \\nThis exercise is to be conducted while sailing out during \\nheightened states/ conflict scenarios.          \\n \\n(b) \\nMesses are to be re-distributed iaw the following guidelines: - \\n \\n(i) \\nThe messes have to be allocated in such a manner that the \\naction posts of the sailors are in close proximity. This would lead \\nto minimum movement/ transit time between their messes and \\naction \\nposts, \\nfurther \\nensuring \\nminimum \\nrequirement \\nto \\ncompromise watertight/ gastight integrity of sections.  \\n  \\n(ii) \\nCapacity of the individual messes are to be factored so that \\ndistribution of sailors should be as per bunk capacity. \\n \\n(iii) \\nShifting of entire luggage of an individual might take time, \\ncreating chaos and distraction onboard. Therefore, during “Battle \\nMessing Plan”, only daily routine kit, change of undergarments \\nand FRAO will be required to be carried to designated messes.  \\n \\n04183. \\nCo-ordinating Instructions. \\n \\n \\n(a) \\nThe ship’s company should automatically assume Battle Messing \\nPlan prior closing up for Sea and Action on occasions brought out at \\npara 04181 (a). \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                  RESTRICTED                          INEXREM (GUN)                   \\n \\n \\nIV-119 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(b) \\nIn case Battle Messing Plan is to be assumed while at sea, \\ntime for change around may not exceed more than 30 minutes for \\n50% of the off-watch ship’s company. \\n \\n04184. \\nOutcome. \\nThe following are the outcomes expected from this \\nexercise:-  \\n \\n(a) \\nShips to prepare individual Battle Messing Plan with the \\nabove mentioned guidelines.

Interference to LOFAR Sensors. Conventional CASEX cannot be \\neffectively used for conduct of LOFAR exercises, primarily because of the \\ninterference caused by consorts in the proximity of LOFAR sonobuoys/ towed \\narray. While operating with Towed Array capable platforms during CASEX, \\nthere will be need to integrate them as advanced screen ships or progress \\ntheir independent Towed Array Work Up. CASEX involving Towed Array fitted \\nships, helos and submarines are described briefly in the succeeding \\nparagraphs.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-15 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n05018.

Preparatory Actions.  Following preparatory actions must be \\nundertaken for LOFAR exercises:- \\n \\n(a) \\nPromulgation of Towed array exercise area with sectors for \\nTowed Array ships and submarine. \\n \\n(b) \\nPromulgation of run plan for the submarine within the submarine \\nzone, which will include course to be steered and the depth to be \\nmaintained by the target submarine. The run plan has to be \\npromulgated in consultation with COMCOS prior departure of the \\nsubmarine. OCS needs to promulgate the machinery regime and the \\nrun plan based on time available and the material state of the \\nsubmarine. The machinery regime should be such as to provide the \\nPTAS operator adequate time for recognition of the acoustic pattern of \\nthe submarine. The run plan should cater to keep the submarine at PD \\nfor minimum two hours.  This would provide adequate opportunity for \\nthe LOFAR operator to be familiar with the submarine discrete and \\nsubmarine to assess the drift in the area. \\n \\n(c) \\nThe run plan promulgated by the OCS should ensure that all \\ntowed array units have equal opportunity to track the target. In order to \\nenhance the value of the exercise, the submarine may be given \\nfreedom of action during Dive phase keeping safety distances in mind. \\n \\n(d) \\nOrdering the Exercise. \\nThe exercise will be promulgated in a \\ndeployment programme. \\nUnits may also carry out the exercise during \\nindependent sailings with prior approval of the SOA. The OCS should \\nissue the standard CASEX signal before proceeding to sea for the \\ntowed array exercise. Detail regarding units, sectors of the towed array \\nships and the time of R/V, communication etc. should be indicated in \\nthe Deployment Programme. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-16 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(e) \\nSea Phase.

Special Considerations.   The considerations that necessitated the \\nrequirement to have separate exercises for towed array fitted ships are:-  \\n \\n(a) Interference caused due to presence of consorts/ merchant ships.  \\n \\n(b) Detection range being dependent on the radiated noise level and \\nhence the speed of the target.  \\n \\n(c) Manoeuvering restrictions of the towed array ship.  \\n \\n(d) Optimum speed for exploitation of towed array being restricted to \\n06 to 10 kn.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-19 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(e) Need to permit the towed array ship to exercise unhindered with a \\ntarget ship/ submarine, so that operators can concentrate on building \\nup the much needed experience and expertise. \\n \\n05028.   CASEX A 96 (Basic Towed Array Exercise).   One tow ship and \\none target submarine are required for conduct of this exercise. In the absence \\nof a submarine, suitable surface consort can be used as a target in this \\nexercise. This exercise is conducted as follows:-  \\n \\n(a) R/V.   The target ship/ submarine and Towed Array ship R/V at the \\ndesignated time after which the tow ship (OCS) promulgates the H-\\nhour. The OCS may also promulgate an IP and an area within which \\nthe target ship/ submarine is free to operate during the exercise.  \\n \\n(b) Phase I (H to H+5h).   The target ship/ submarine is ordered to \\nsteer a steady course at PD till H+5 hours, while the tow ship opens \\nout and closes the target ship/ submarine to establish the maximum \\ntracking range (MTR).  \\n \\n(c) Phase II (H+5h to H+8h).   The target ship/ submarine maintains \\na steady course and speed and dives to safe depth for the duration of \\nPhase II. The tow ship opens out and closes the target ship/ \\nsubmarine to establish maximum tracking range.  \\n \\n(d) Machinery.   The machinery to be run by the target and the tow \\nship and the sequence in which it is switched on/ off, is to be as \\npromulgated in orders/ pre-exercise briefing or as per WAS  \\nMemo - 09.  \\n \\n(e) Surfacing.   The submarine is to be surfaced by following the full \\nsurfacing procedure at the end of the exercise.  \\n \\n05029.   CASEX A 97 (Intermediate Towed Array Exercise).    This exercise \\nis similar to CASEX A 96, except that an ASW helicopter also participates in \\nthis exercise. The units participating are one Towed Array ship, one target \\nsubmarine and one helo. The exercise is conducted as follows:-  \\n \\n(a) R/V.   The target submarine and tow ship are to R/V at the \\ndesignated time after which the tow ship (OCS) promulgates the        \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-20 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\nH-hour.

The submarine is ordered to steer a steady \\ncourse at PD till H+5 hours, while the tow ship opens out and closes \\nthe target submarine to establish the maximum tracking range. The \\ntow ship is to launch the helo during Phase I, either based on \\nsubmarine discretes or at a prearranged time for a fixed duration. The \\nASW helo is to detect, localise and track the submarine using \\nsonobuoys. Shore based helo could also be used depending upon \\nvicinity of exercise area.  \\n \\n(c) Phase II (H+5h to H+8h).   The target submarine maintains a \\nsteady course and speed and dives to safe depth for the duration of \\nPhase II. The tow ship opens out and closes the target ship/ \\nsubmarine to establish the maximum tracking range. \\n \\n05030.   CASEX A 98 (Towed Array Exercise with Horizontal Separation).  \\nThe purpose of the exercise is to involve upto four TA ships in basic \\nclassification, tracking, TMA generation and cross fixing procedures with \\nTowed Array SONAR – streaming depth unrestricted. Integral helos (if \\ndeployed) are to use only sonobuoys. The procedure to be followed is outlined \\nvide draft CASEX with ATAS (Adv) was promulgated by INTEG vide letter \\n700/ATAS dated 24 Nov 22. The CASEX provides necessary freedom to the \\nsubmarine to change her depth without any restriction. It also provides PTAS \\nships adequate freedom to change PTAS depth as per the bathy profile, \\nhence having better opportunity in tracking the submarine. Salient points \\nregarding conduct of the exercise are as follows:- \\n \\n(a) \\nExercise Area.  The submarine is restricted to an area \\nmeasuring 10 Nm x 10 Nm oriented North-South. A Safety Zone of \\n2000 yards is established all around the perimeter of the area. \\n \\n(b) \\nInitial Positions.

Guiding Documents. \\nDetails of actions to be taken in the event of \\na submarine emergency are given in INBR 1524 (2003, 2022) (Submarine \\nSearch and Rescue Manual) and Submarine Search and Rescue Orders \\n(ENSUB 10/ WENSUB 03).  \\n \\n \\nSMASHEX  \\n \\n05032.   Whenever SUBMISS/ SUBSUNK is to exercised, the code word \\n“SMASHEX” will be used for ordering these exercises. During these exercises \\nall the actions required for the SUBMISS/ SUBSUNK are to be taken. The \\nexercises may be either “SMASHEX ONE” for SUBMISS or “SMASHEX TWO” \\nfor SUBSUNK. In case, it is desired to exercise only for paper action then \\n“SMASHEX PAPER” code will be used. The format for ordering these will be \\nas follows:-  \\n \\n(a) \\nSMASHEX.  \\n \\n(i) \\nAll signals are to be prefixed “SMASHEX”.  \\n \\n(ii) \\nAll actions as per SUBMISS/ SUBSUNK will be carried \\nout.  \\n \\n(iii) In the event of a genuine emergency within or immediately \\nadjacent to the Command area, “SMASHEX” will be cancelled \\nby signal.

All practice torpedo firings by ships are conducted as follows:-  \\n \\n(a) \\nThe target submarine is ordered to steer a steady course and \\nspeed.  \\n \\n(b) \\nThe firing/ recovery and SONAR listening ship are positioned as \\nrequired.  \\n \\n(c) \\nThe submarine remains on PD/ is ordered to dive to safe depth \\nas given in the Torpedo Firing Orders.  \\n \\n(d) \\nThere are two runs; a dummy run for about 45 min to 01 hour \\nfollowed by the firing run.  \\n \\n(e) \\nThe firing ship maneuvers as required for the dummy run and \\nreturns to the IP prior to commencing the firing run.  \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-32 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(f) \\nThe actions to be taken by the firing ship, OCS, target \\nsubmarine, recovery ship, SONAR listening ship and spotting \\nhelicopter are given in TFRO 23.  \\n \\n \\nConduct of a Tactical Torpedo Firing by Ships  \\n \\n05045.   Difference.   The essential difference between a structured firing as \\ndescribed above and a tactical firing, is that, in a tactical firing the position \\ncourse and speed of the target submarine are not known to the firing ship. A \\ntactical firing is, therefore, as close to reality as possible.  \\n \\n05046.   Conduct. The procedure for conduct of a tactical firing is as follows:-   \\n \\n(a) Although the exact position, course and speed of the target \\nsubmarine is not known, the submarine is restricted to a circle of \\napproximately 3 to 5 nm radius (Referred to as submarine probable \\narea - SPA).  \\n \\n(b) The submarine is to dive to the depth given in the firing orders by \\nGO Time.  \\n \\n(c) The firing ship is to enter the SPA after GO Time and commence \\nsearch for the target submarine.  \\n \\n(d) The firing ship may be assisted in the search by another ASW \\nship, with both ships forming a SAU. \\n \\n(e) On gaining SONAR contact, the firing ship is to make three-charge \\nsignal, to indicate commencement of AS action. The target submarine \\nis to steer steady course/ speed as ordered in the firing orders. The \\nfiring ship is to ensure that the target motion parameters generated \\nmatches with the course/ speed promulgated in the firing orders.  \\n \\n(f) As a measure of artificiality and in order to avoid firing on a non-\\nsub contact, the firing ship is to drop a two-charge signal after gaining \\nSONAR contact. On hearing the signal the target submarine is to \\nindicate her position by firing an SSE. The firing ship is to compare the \\nvisual bearing of the SSE with the SONAR bearing, and launch the \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-33 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\ntorpedo only if the difference in bearing is less than 5 degrees. This \\nmay be amended if required by the Firing Orders. If the procedure of \\nundertaking launch only after sighting the SSE needs to be dispensed \\nwith (given the high failure rate of the SSEs), the same needs to be \\nclearly brought out in the TFX Orders issued by the Operational \\nAuthority.   \\n \\n(g) \\nThe spotting helicopter is to be launched (preferably by the \\nassisting ship) 10 mins before the torpedo is fired.  \\n \\n(h) \\nIn addition, the assisting ship must endeavor to remain outside \\nthe Weapon Danger Zone of the torpedo until the run of the torpedo is \\ncompleted. If she finds herself in the WDZ, she is to immediately stop \\nship to prevent seducing the torpedo. \\n \\n(j) \\nAfter the torpedo has been launched and on completion of it’s \\nrun, the submarine is to be surfaced by the standard surfacing \\nprocedure.  \\n \\n(k) \\nWhile the surfacing procedure is in progress, the spotting \\nhelicopter is to search for the torpedo, drop a smoke marker near the \\ntorpedo and hover on top of it until the arrival of the recovery ship.  \\n \\n(l) \\nAction to be taken and duties of the firing ship, OCS, target \\nsubmarine, recovery ship etc. are specified in TFRO 23.  \\n \\nNote.   A ship should be scheduled for a tactical firing only after \\nhaving carried out at least two structured torpedo firings.  \\n \\n \\nConduct of a Helo - Ship Vectored Torpedo Attack  \\n \\n05047.   The procedure of conduct of a Helo - Ship VECTAC DAGGER 1/ 2/ 3 \\nhave been promulgated vide INTI-23.  \\n \\n05048.   Conduct of VECTAC. \\nThe procedure in brief is as follows:-  \\n \\n(a) \\nThe ships and submarine effect R/V.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-34 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(b) \\nThe firing ship is stationed on the port/ stbd quarter of the \\nsubmarine at 3 to 4 nm. The vectoring ship is stationed ahead of the \\nfiring ship at 1 to 1.5 nm.  \\n \\n(c) \\nThe submarine is to initially be at PD, maintaining a steady \\ncourse and speed. After the vectoring and firing ships have taken \\nstation at IP, the submarine may be ordered to dive to safe depth/ \\nremain at PD depending on the depth at which the torpedo is intended \\nto be fired.  \\n \\n(d) \\nThe vectoring ship is to transmit on SONAR and the firing ship \\nSONAR is to be passive.  \\n \\n(e) \\nThe vectoring ship is to pass target data to the firing ship by \\nmethod A or B or C.  \\n \\n(f) \\nThere will be two runs, a dummy run for approximately 45 min \\nfollowed by a firing run. Both ships are to maneuver simultaneously by \\nturn signals during the run (The firing ship is to be the guide).  \\n \\n(g) \\nBoth ships are to return to IP before commencing the firing run. \\n  \\n(h) \\nThe spotting helicopter is to be launched (preferably from the \\nvectoring ship) just before the torpedo is fired.  \\n \\n(j) \\nWhen the firing ship has obtained the target motion parameters, \\nthe torpedo is to be launched and subsequently recovered as per \\nnormal procedure. \\n  \\n(k) \\nThe submarine is to be surfaced by the normal surfacing \\nprocedure on completion of the torpedo run duration.  \\n \\n \\nConduct of Torpedo Firing by Helicopters  \\n \\n05049.   Three varieties of torpedoes can be dropped by helicopters viz \\nCombat, Exercise and Dummy/ Drill/ Balwanka versions.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-35 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n05050.   Conduct of A244S (D&P) Drop.  A244S (D&P) drop is carried out on \\na danbuoy. The conduct of these drops, in brief, is as follows:-  \\n \\n(a) \\nA danbuoy with a radar reflector and flag is laid in the drifting \\nmode. \\n  \\n(d) \\nA recovery boat with recovery gear and crew is lowered and \\npositioned in the vicinity of the danbuoy. \\n \\n (c) The ship launches the helicopter and after ascertaining that the \\ndanbuoy is painting on the radar, carries out a VECTAC on the \\ndanbuoy.  \\n \\n(d) \\nTwo runs are normally carried out. The first is a dummy run \\nfollowed by the firing run, in which the helicopter controller is to \\nrelease the torpedo 200 yards from the danbuoy. \\n  \\n(e) \\nImmediately after the torpedo is released the recovery gemini \\ncloses the torpedo and recovers it. \\n  \\n(f) \\nThereafter the torpedo, GPIC, danbuoy and helicopter are \\nrecovered on board the launch ship.  \\n \\n(g) \\nA244S (D&P) drops are to be carried out in area with minimum \\n150m depth of water.  \\n \\n05051.   Conduct of A 244S (Exercise Head Air Drops).   The exercise head \\nA244S drop is conducted as follows:-  \\n \\n(a) \\nThe target submarine is ordered to steer a steady course and \\nspeed.  \\n \\n(b) \\nThe launch helicopter dunks on the stbd/ port side of the \\nsubmarine within the prevailing ESR range.  \\n \\n(c) \\nThereafter the submarine is dived to the depth ordered after \\nconfirming her readiness.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-36 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(d) \\nThe launch helicopter is to launch the torpedo in hover when \\ncarrying out self-attack. In case of VECTAC it can fire either in \\nhovering or in flight mode. However, the exercise torpedo has to be \\nprepared accordingly.  \\n \\n(e) \\nThe same launch helicopter could be used for spotting the \\ntorpedo after it has completed its run and surfaced. However, it is \\npreferable to employ Chetak for spotting.

The \\nMine/ MCM Warfare Exploitation Document 2020 is to be read in conjunction \\nas it introduces the concepts and principles of Mine Warfare and assist officers \\nin planning and conduct of Mining and MCM operations.  \\n \\n05060.   Scope.   This chapter briefly covers the following topics. However, it \\nshould be read in conjunction with The Mine/ MCM Warfare Exploitation \\nDocument 2020 and policy letters in force on the subject:-  \\n \\n(a) Inventory and Assets available. \\n \\n(b) Responsibility. \\n \\n(c) State of Readiness. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-43 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n(d) \\nMine and MCM Exercises.  \\n \\n(e) \\nMine Delineation Exercises. \\n \\n(f) \\nMiscellaneous. \\n \\n(g) \\nPlanning and conduct of MCM Operations.  \\n \\n05061.   The current inventory of IN MCM capability consists of the following \\nsystems: - \\n \\n(a) \\nClip On Influence Sweep (CLOIS). \\n(b) \\nMine Hunting SONAR Suite (MHSS). \\n(c)     Side Scan SONAR (SSS). \\n(d) \\nMine Warfare Data Centre (MWDC). \\n \\n05062.   The aspects covered in this chapter has taken cognisance of A2VS \\nsquadrons and the assets available. Details of assets available and envisaged \\nare placed at Appendix ‘A’. However, the revision of this publication is \\nongoing process and will be governed by capabilities and limitations of new \\nassets planned to be inducted in future. The SOPs of the vessels in A2VS as \\nand when promulgated would be incorporated in this document as an \\naddendum. Coordinating instructions issued by appropriate authorities to \\nbe referred for the conduct of specific exercises. For exercises involving \\nMCM and EOD (such as EOD and Mine Disposal Ex) specific orders issued by \\nNHQ/ DSOD, CSODs be referred. \\n \\n05063.   Mine warfare embodies the strategic, operational and tactical \\nemployment of mines and related countermeasures.  The laying of mine is \\naimed at degrading the enemy’s mobility and thereby his ability to conduct \\noperations. MCM on the other hand aims to counter the mines laid by enemy, \\nthereby enabling the continuation of own operations, that the enemy had \\nsought to prevent. MCM ships of the flotilla are to therefore remain in state of \\ncombat readiness so as to accomplish the tasks assigned to them. The \\nsucceeding paragraphs lay down instructions for compliance to achieve the \\nsame. \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-44 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\nResponsibility \\n \\n05064.

MCM Options.  The various options available for MCM are \\narticulated in Chapter II and VI of MCM Exploitation Document 2020.  \\n \\n05073.   MCM Risk Directives.  When ordering MCM Operations, Risk \\nDirectives are issued. MCM Risk Directives are normally ordered by the \\nOperational Commander and they provide a framework within which MCM \\nassets can be tasked. Generally, shorter the time available for operations, \\ngreater the risk to MCM assets and vice versa. The three MCM Risk directives \\nare as follows: - \\n \\n(a) \\nDirective Alpha. \\nThe primary concern is to minimise the risk \\nto MCM assets. The timely completion of task is of secondary \\nimportance.  \\n \\n(b) \\nDirective Bravo. \\nBalance the risk to the MCM assets with the \\navailable time line, so as to complete the task. \\n \\n(c) \\nDirective Charlie. \\n The timely completion of task is of primary \\nimportance. Risk to MCM assets is of secondary importance. \\n \\n05074.   Classification of Channel. \\nThe various channel classifications to \\nbe used during MCM operations are articulated in INTI-23 by use of colour \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-53 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\ncoding. Actions to be taken by ships whilst passing through mined waters and \\non detection of mine are also covered in the same chapter.       \\n \\n \\nPlanning and Conduct of MCM Operations \\n \\n05075.   Localising the Threat.  Threat from mines can be localised by \\nestablishing a system of routing ships away from mined waters and by \\nestablishing an effective mine warning system. It is desirable that a network of \\nroute should be planned in peace time. An important measure undertaken as \\npart of passive MCM is the establishment of a system of transit routes, \\nreferred to as Q-routes, which will minimise the presence of ships in potentially \\nmined waters. Establishment of ‘Q’ routes is one of the first steps taken by \\nMCM planners to minimise exposure of the shipping to mines and enable \\nactive MCM efforts to be concentrated in areas where these are unavoidable. \\nIntelligence and reconnaissance is necessary for designation of ‘Q’ routes. \\nShips leave or enter harbour by using the Swept Channels which are derived \\nfrom the ‘Q’ routes. Such channels vary in width and usually start at the \\nharbour entrance or boom gate and extend seaward. A swept channel being \\nordered in support of various operations should be defined in the following four \\ndimensions:- \\n \\n(a) \\n Length of channel (in nautical mile). \\n \\n(b) \\n Width of channel (ideally between 300 - 1000 yards). \\n \\n(c) \\n Duration for which the swept channel is to be maintained (qualified \\nby start time and date to stop time and date). \\n \\n(d) \\n Classification to be established as Green, Blue, Yellow, Black, \\nRed, etc. \\n \\n05076.   Single/ Multiple Swept Channels.  Any swept channel requirement \\nshould cater for an alternate arrangement, if one is rendered unusable due to \\nattrition mining by the enemy or due to tactical factors. A replenished channel \\nwill require again, sweeping efforts during which time, passage of ship in and \\nout of harbours will be hampered with. The presence of one or more alternate \\nchannels to the harbour will not affect the in and out traffic due to attrition \\nmining in one channel. Shipping can be divided in both channels, thereby \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-54 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\nreducing the time required for searching the approaches to the channels for \\nships arriving from different directions. The efforts involved in maintaining this \\nchannel is definitely more, but the advantage far outnumbers this effort.  \\nTherefore, it is imperative that at least one alternate swept channel is planned \\nfor the ports where mining in likely to be expected. In order to facilitate \\nentering or leaving a harbour reference points may be used. Such as Point A, \\nPoint X, Point O and Point Y. If more than one swept channel is established, \\nPoint A1, A2, X1, X2 and so forth would be used.  \\n \\n \\n05077.   Sheltered Anchorages for Merchant Ships.  Prior to the \\ncommencement of hostilities sheltered anchorages for merchant ships need to \\nbe established to safeguard them from air attack. These areas may also be \\nused for the transshipment of super tankers and other deep draught vessels, \\nprovided the depth of water is sufficient.  Sheltered anchorages should be \\nestablished beyond the 50 meter sounding line to reduce the risk of ground \\nmines. Where the risk of submarine/air attack is predominant rather than the \\nrisk of encountering the ground mines, these sheltered anchorages into waters \\ncloser to the mouth of the harbour and possibly in mineable waters.  \\n \\n05078.   Length of Swept Channel.   The following factors should be \\nconsidered while deciding the length of channel to be swept:- \\n \\n(a) \\nDepth of water should be sufficient for safe transit of all traffic. \\n \\n(b) \\nThe minimum depth of water for point X can be 20 m and point Y \\nfor ground mines can be 60 m. Moored mines are expected up to \\ndepths of 1100 m. \\n \\n(c) \\nThe ability of own MCM forces to sustain swept channel for the \\nduration of conflict is to be borne in mind. Point Y should be \\nsufficiently distant from X such that upon crossing it, traffic should \\nhave multiple diversions from the coast. \\n \\n05079.   Width of the Channel. One of the most important decisions in a \\nswept channel of a particular harbour is the channel width. A very narrow will \\nforce the large bodied ships into un-swept waters. If the channel is too wide, \\nthe sweeping efforts required to clear and maintain the channel free of mines \\nwill be inordinately large, and may waste MCM efforts which could have been \\nprofitably utilised elsewhere. The channel width between 300 - 1000 yds is \\nrecommended, while keeping the following points in consideration:- \\n \\n \\n \\n                                       RESTRICTED                   INEXREM (ASW) \\n \\n \\n        V-55 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRICTED \\n \\n \\n \\n(a) \\nDamage radius of the expected mine. \\n \\n(b) \\nNavigational/ position fixing facilities. \\n \\n(c) \\nTidal current/ streams in that area. \\n \\n(d) \\nDepth of water. \\n \\n(e) \\nMaximum beam width of the ship expected to pass through. \\n \\n(f) \\nMaximum draught of the largest ship expected to pass through. \\n \\n(g) \\nAvailability of degaussing equipment. \\n \\n(h) \\nMagnetic, acoustic and pressure signatures of the ship. \\n \\n(j) \\nSensitivity of the expected mine. \\n \\n(k) \\nSpeed of movement of the ships in harbour. \\n \\n(l) \\nTraffic density. \\n \\n05080.   Calculation of the Swept Channel. While considering the above \\nfactors the minimum width of the swept channel can be calculated by summing \\nup the following: - \\n \\n \\n(a) \\nMine Damage Width (MDW). \\n   \\n(b) \\nSix times the Standard Deviation to Navigational Error (SDNE σ). \\n \\n(c) \\nTactical diameter of the ship. \\n \\nSwept Channel Width = MDW + 6 σ + Tactical Diameter. \\n \\n05081.   MCMV Safety Measures.   Safety of the MCMV is one of the most \\nimportant factors to be considered when choosing appropriate techniques and \\npatterns. Protection of the MCMV from mine explosion damage is always \\nimportant, even when the urgency of the operation demands that the rate of \\nsweeping or searching be considered foremost.
